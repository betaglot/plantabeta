### Example of a Value

- Text
    - RequiredMove
    - Force required
    - Direction of travel
    - Instruction for what to do next.
- Number
    - Density
    - TreeCount
    - RouteSequenceNumber
    - MoveSequenceNumber
    - StepCount
- Location
    - TargetLocation in the Eco.
    - PotentialMicrosite
    - 
- Array
    - MoveSequence
    - Set of Submoves
    - RouteSequence

### Outcome > Output

False value is a bunch of features that Planters don't use. The value of a stump is not its color (HexadecimalValue, RGB values), rather value comes from the stump's PotentialMicrosites. The RouteElement(PotentialMicrosite, FlagSite) gives the EcoElement(Stump) value

Theorem the name of an object, while Problem is the object's values and methods.


### Value Exchange



The value exchange of woven fiber neighbors is the tension force holding each other in place. Warp Weft. ForceExchange.

Subsystems give each other value.

The RouteElement(GoodMicrosite, FlagSite) gives the EcoElement(Stump) value. The stump gives Route value by providing PotentialMicrosite.

The exchange doesn't need to be mutually beneficial. Both ValueAddition or (ValueAddition + ValueSubtraction).

What does paired element get in return?

### Value Chain

Also known as a Value Stream.

Value is added along a sequence of steps. Like Bioamplification of poison in Predatory Birds 

- Exponential 
- [Addition of MarginalGains Infographic]

### MoveElementValue

::: tip MoveElementValue Addition

---

**Saves Time**
- FlagMove while Walking away.
- Use one forceful ScreefMove instead of many weak ScreefMoves.
- FootScreef a thin DuffLayer instead of bending over to ShovelScreef.   

**Simplifies**
- MoveShape 
- HighFlag your LineIn to make it easier for the Planter in a neighbouring piece to see their piece boundary lines. 

**Reduces Risk**
- SpadeProbe the soil to reduce the risk of hurting your wrist by hitting a subsurface rock. 
- Reduce the risk of injury by learning how to fall properly.
- Use ArmFlag to reduce the risk of Falling.

**Connects**
- AbsorbMove allows smooth transitions between Moves.
- Use ArmAbsorb to redirect Spade during ShovelMoves.

**Reduces Effort**
- Remove Clothing Layer to reduce your body's need for sweat.
- Stick Spade in the ground when you get to the cache to avoid having to pick it up from the ground when you return to the Eco. 

**Avoids Hassles**
- BodyRotate before BodySlot to prevent BagSnag
- Any Snag is a hassle
- ArmBlock to prevent getting hit with a branch in the face.
- Adjust your bags to avoid getting abraisions on your hips.

**Reduces Cost**
- Flag is a cost in money terms and Planter resources too.

**Increases Variety**
- HandClose is more versitile than FootClose.

**SensoryAppeal**
- Not listening to music with headphones, so you can hear the properties of the soil. 

**Informs**
- SpadeProbe to feel the ground instead of only using vision for MicrositeSelection.

**Access**
- Fold a plant out of the way of Hole.
- Move a branch out of the way when walking through Slash or a residual patch.

- FlagRipError so that the flag is longer than it needs to be.

**Reduces Variety**
- LimitedRangeOfMotion
- Tight Clothing

**Obscures (SensoryAppeal)**

MoveSelection.MoveEvaluation
    - "Is that the **best** move for the current BetaInstance"
    - Neuro.Judgement
        - All evaluations are judgements. See Kahneman
    - What is the most valuable move gi
    - Which move solves the current state?
- Energy to move.
- Knowing where to go
    - Route
- Knowing how to move
    - MoveSelection

- Required Tools 
    - A spade is more valuable than an extractor since it can solve more problems more efficiently. A spade solves the same problems as an extractor and can solve even more problems than an extractor.

#### MoveValue
- Successful SpadeProbe PositiveEcoTest. The Spade goes in deep enough to bury the seedling's roots.
- HoleOpen gives value to InsertTree

#### RelativeValue
- TallPersonBeta 
    - "That ContactSurface isn't useful for me"
    - TeamPlant

#### RouteValue

#### EcoValue
- RockCap is not valuable for planting.
- CreamyEco

Value is added along the chain of steps. PlantingSequence

MicrositeValidation Threshold MinimumValue
- SoilProperties
- ObstacleFill
- 

Microsite gets more and more valuable until the hole is closed
