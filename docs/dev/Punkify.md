# Betaglot Punkified

## What is Betaglot?

Betaglot is a system to describe the experience of athletes in sports with no opponent who is opposing you while you perform. It can either be a solo sport or one where athletes work as a team.

Some of the sports which Betaglot can describe are:

- Climbing
- Whitewater Kayaking
- Skiing
    - Aerial Skiing
    - Freestyle Skiing
    - Snowpark Skiing
- Skateboarding
- Gymnastics
- Diving

In all of these sports athletes, must perform specific Aktions. These Aktions go by different names in each sport (trick, move, element, maneuver), the similarity between all Aktions are that they are performed and judged based on the Execution, Difficulty and Variety

::: info

Before going any further, you will notice that some of the spellings that Betaglot uses are not English, this is because whenever possible I have tried to use names which are composed of a hybrid between Latin and Greek. This naming convention is designed to fit into the language of Biology, Physics, Geology and Psychology, which are all based in Latin or Greek. The purpose of this is to enable people from various languages to be able use the names without translation. To ensure that the names are easy to pronounce Betaglot uses the letter "K" instead of "C" when relevant and omits silent letters. So if I were to write my name Christopher with the Betaglot naming convention it would be Kristofer, which is like how many other languages write it.

The languages which Betaglot needs to be understandable in are:

- English
- French
- Spanish
- Portuguese

These are the most common languages (besides Chinese and Russian) and are the official languages of the Americas, the majority of Europe, all of Africa and some of Asia.

## What are the components of Betaglot?

![Betaglot_Logo](/PlantaBeta_Logo.png)

As you can see in the Betaglot logo, there are six parts. Each part has its own color and symbol associated with it

1. ⭐ <span class="labor">LABOR</span>
1. 🔷 <span class="soma">SOMA</span>
1. 🟩 <span class="ekos">EKOS</span>
1. 🔻 <span class="via">VIA</span>
1. 🟠 <span class="motor">MOTOR</span>
1. 💜 <span class="anima">ANIMA</span>

Each category represents a different component of an athlete's experience

⭐<span class="labor">LABOR</span> is the goal or purpose of an experience.

In climbing LABOR is experienced as the competition, the route, the other competitors, the time limit, the tools you use, the clothes you wear and any other rules or regulations.

A simple example of an Aktion is reaching. When you reach for something there is an intrinsic goal, to actually get to and establish a grip on a hold.

A more complex element of LABOR is a route. The goal of a route is to get to the top of it, or at least get to the Zone Hold in bouldering.

::: details Here are some more Aktions

- Going through a <span class="labor">Gate</span> in Slalom Skiing, and Kayaking
- <span class="labor">Reaching</span> with your foot or hand or hip
- Performing a <span class="labor">backflip</span>
- Performing a <span class="labor">dyno</span>
- <span class="labor">Heel Hook, Toe Hook</span>
- <span class="labor">Falling</span>
- <span class="labor">Rolling</span> your kayak
- <span class="labor">Jumping</span> off a ski jump
- <span class="labor">Grinding</span> on a rail
- Performing an <span class="labor">Ollie</span>
- Performing a <span class="labor">Handstand</span>
- <span class="labor">Gripping</span> a Sloper
- <span class="labor">Crimping</span> an Edge
- <span class="labor">Mobility</span>

Every person has a different body. The category 🔷<span class="soma">SOMA</span> (which is just greek for "body") describes the body part used to perform the Aktion and the specific properties are the body part and body in general.

The length of your arms, BMI, total body height, age, ape index etc. all affect the way that an athlete performs an Aktion.

You can perform the same Aktion with a different body part. You can <span class="labor">Reach</span> with your <span class="soma">Arm</span> or <span class="labor">Reach</span> with your <span class="soma">Leg</span>

::: details Some elements of <span class="soma">SOMA</span>

- <span class="soma">Arm, Leg, Hand, Finger, Torso, Head, Foot</span>
- <span class="soma">VO2 max, Lung Capacity</span>
- <span class="soma">Age, Child, Teen, Senior</span>
- <span class="soma">Skin, Nail, Hair</span>
- <span class="soma">Injuries</span>
- <span class="soma">Muscle, Limberness,Tendons, Ligaments </span>
- <span class="soma">Food, Electrolytes, the need to breathe</span>

Athletes aren't just floating in space, they are on Earth. 🟩<span class="ekos">EKOS</span> (which is based on "Ecosystem", since the "eco" is greek for home or environment).

::: details Elements of <span class="ekos">EKOS</span> include:

- Water, Rain, Snow, Ice
- Climbing Wall, Climbing Hold
- Dirt, Sand, Rock, Trees, Plants
- Air, Wind
- Mountain, Valley
- Stairs
- The ground
- A ski jump
- A crack in the rock

Say you're skiing down a slope and there is an obstacle in your path, you can go left or right around it. The part of your experience which deals with the particular way that you perform an Aktion is 🔻<span class="via">VIA</span>.

The core component of <span class="via">VIA</span> is <span class="via">Affordance</span>. You must perceive that your path, method, location is possible.

::: details Elements of <span class="via">VIA</span> include:

- Direction (up, down, in, out, across, over ...)
- Geometry (Shape, Form)
- Probability (likely, possible, impossible)
- Logic (If-then, Causality)
- Position (north, south, upper, lower, beside)

To actually move through time and space you require 🟠<span class="motor">MOTOR</span>. This category represents your experience of motion in Time. <span class="motor">MOTOR</span> includes all of Kinematic Physics (motion, speed, acceleration, time) and Dynamics Physics (force, velocity, momentum, inertia). The person who's work best represents what <span class="motor">MOTOR</span> is all about is Isaac Newton.

---

The last, but most fundamental of all the categories is 💜<span class="anima">ANIMA</span> (which was "Psyche" for about a year, but I decided that it's difficult to pronounce and a lot of people have a negative view of "Psychology, Psychiatrist ..."). <span class="anima">ANIMA</span> can be translated as "soul". Unlike the other categories <span class="anima">ANIMA</span> is mostly not visible from a third person point of view. The foundation of <span class="anima">ANIMA</span> and all other categories is Awareness, also called consciousness . Awareness is where "you" are, it's where your thoughts and sensations occur. <span class="anima">ANIMA</span> is not logical, it is emotional, intuitive, instinctual and is usually non-verbal. <span class="anima">ANIMA</span> is anything that occurs in your nervous system.

Although your eyes are part of your body, Betaglot categorizes them as <span class="anima">ANIMA</span>, given that your retina is literally part of your brain.

::: details Elements of <span class="anima">ANIMA</span> include:

- Attention
- Touch, Sight, Hearing, Taste, Proprioception
- Emotions, Moods
- Understanding, Intuition, Recognition
- Sense of Balance
- Metacognition
- Any thought

:::

## How do the categories go together?

Betaglot is a combinatory system. The unit of combination is called a 🌈BETOM (the rainbow icon has all the colors of Betaglot).

Betoms must include at least two elements and are surrounded by square brackets

[<span class="labor">LABOR</span>, <span class="soma">SOMA</span>, <span class="ekos">EKOS</span>, <span class="via">VIA</span> <span class="motor">MOTOR</span>, <span class="anima">ANIMA</span>]

or represented digitally as these boxes

<BC l='LABOR's='SOMA'e='EKOS'v='VIA'm='MOTOR'a='ANIMA'/>

The order in which the elements of each category is listed is fixed

1. ⭐ <span class="labor">LABOR</span>
1. 🔷 <span class="soma">SOMA</span>
1. 🟩 <span class="ekos">EKOS</span>
1. 🔻 <span class="via">VIA</span>
1. 🟠 <span class="motor">MOTOR</span>
1. 💜 <span class="anima">ANIMA</span>
