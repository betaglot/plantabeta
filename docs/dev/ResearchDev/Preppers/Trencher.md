# Trencher

- Trencher
    - I guess continuing the lines after going around obstacles
    Foresight into exit strategies for pinch points.
    - Oblong areas or fingers require backing up to create squares to work off of for rest of blocks
    - Backing up to the danger zone of wet areas
    - The GPS is set at 10 second intervals if I remember correct so yes spacing would be related to speed.
    - I did deadwalk down a road to the furthest point of the block to start, mostly so I end my day closer to my truck.
    - I don't really get much feedback on how it looks only asked why I wasn't able to hit areas.
