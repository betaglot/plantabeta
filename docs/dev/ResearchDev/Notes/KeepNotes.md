    - Watch out for people always In and around You’re piece calling 4’s and taking out trees behind you’re back.  
    - Consistently giving you the worst piece, making you wait for trees or telling you they will be right back and never come, giving everyone a price bump except you. Sticking you in a room with a stranger of the opposite gender telling you don’t tell the bosses !!
    Lying to you about what pests are in the rooms you stay at. Gaslighting others into following their lead of tormenting you. Don’t be better then anyone or they will make up a reason to get rid of you. Holes not closed etc .. they will do whatever they can to make sure you aren’t getting fast and are miserable out there. Leave these places and never look back!!
    If they are overweight and miserable / always complaining about someone or something the chances of this happening to you goes up by 80% they will plant you’re piece for you if you allow them in the land to cream you out 100% of the time!
    Kiss ass show up everyday shut up and do you’re best because no one will do it for you and you are the only one who will and can take responsibility.
    - Writing / leaving notes for updates at your cache if you have not seen them but know they are around. trees (The big ones), boxes, rocks with flagger tied to it. ANYTHING. Duct tape works amazing as well for this. If you have a cache and you know you always miss your crew boss leaving a quick note saying "im ok but need more trees" can save you both a lot of time find more stuff to plant.
    - being a good planter doesn't make you a good crew boss. Crew bossing is its own beast and there's no real comparison to planting.
    - I like when they're nice to me. Maybe a concrete version of this is the tone of voice and body language
    - When you ask them why they foreman and they say "Because I didn't want to plant anymore". I hate that shit so much.
    - Don't say "one more bag up" 20 times
    - eating and sleeping, sometimes you have to feed your crew boss for everybody’s benefit.
    - Kindness is huge. Rude comments make for bad work environment. Only happened with one small company though.
    Great crew bosses are kind, encouraging and good at understanding how to move you around and how trees go in etc. They also provide good instruction for you so you can quickly orient yourself in a piece.
    - don't EVER say we're going home early unless we're in the truck on the way home
    - Increase: when they know that you are making money for them, and they prepare every cache you need, internal and external; when they fix a couple of trees for you instead of smoking joints in the block and make you replant.
    Decrease: when they just have ego and they need to increase their ego instead of the motivation of their planters.
    - willing to move a box / tray into the back of my piece when the back line is really far
    - doesn’t make promises they can’t keep
    - has a thorough block plan so people aren’t waiting for trees. Shit happens , but showing they are prepared for multiple contingencies
    - there for a chat when I need to let off steam, but leaves me alone when I just want to pound
    - has an even temper / keeps calm. Bad moods are infectious and they especially roll downhill. Bad days are easier when your crew boss is stoic and cool about it.
    - I think the main thing crew bosses need to realize is that they work for you. A good crew boss will do what needs to be done to make your job easier. Also, being open to suggestions wrt to your piece. If you can suggest an upgrade to your plan without creaming someone, and your foreman is open/receptive to it - that's huge (Speaking from a lifer's perspective). Young planters obviously have to earn the trust of their foreman before they're accommodated / taken seriously.
    - Text back planters in the off season about returning, even if they don’t wanna hire them again, just letting them know, probably goes a long way
    - When I was a rookie, my foreman planting with me was gold. Especially in technical land.
    When I was a crew leader, a one-size-fits-all leadership approach was not always effective. I found that giving talented, competent vets more freedom was great, but don't forget that they can also have bad days psychologically, and they won't be a superstar every single day. Checking in with them (or forgetting to) and reading facial and body languages (or not) led both to successes and mistakes for me.
    - Had a crew boss buy a set of personal radios- different than the company ones that crew bosses used. He'd leave you with one if you were isolated or close to wrapping your piece so you could call him when you were close to finishing. I don't think I waited for trees or land that entire season. A bit of an investment but it paid off for everyone

    - A crew boss who will sit and chat / share snacks / darts when going through a tough one is really nice.
    That might not "increase" the efficiency of my crew boss, but it might make me wrap a piece that I wasn't planning on finishing.
    Decrease: spending hours packing trees in land, like tf hire someone to pack trees I need my foreman to be fit and energized.
    - Well cut pieces timing knowing your planters, establishing the relationship of how you work, oh yea respect and manners or im just leaving knowing how to help someone do better, saying its all shit and garbage is social suicide
    - My crew boss once saw me struggling. She brought me a full bag up of trees to the end of piece so I didn't have to walk all the way back to the cache without planting
    - Plant a couple bundies in shit land is always nice
    - First season of having a crewboss set up caches days or even a week ahead was definitely a positive change, willingness or even just lugging boxes to the back of a piece or to a choke point... And naturally having extra smokes for the planters. Not treating a planter like a baby and letting them, and supporting them doing their own thing is great, too (as far as completing a piece).
    - Can confirm my foreman from my rookie season was the ONLY one who didn't set up on days off and we ran out of trees and had fuck around days more in a season than my boyfriend in 6 years. She was also a rookie foreman with 9 rookies on her crew but she had 10 years of experience in the bush. When I came back last year this other girl had only been planting for 4 years when she tried to foreman, she had ballers on her crew and was killing it every day.
    - Best crew bosses I've had did shit in the background that I had no idea needed to be done,
    - tagging ng along for stuff crew bosses are supposed to do before or after planters are dropped off sucks. 8-10 hours of physical labour I want the most recovery time possible (sitting in a truck is not recovery)
    - when they need to demonstrate that they are the best, full of experience and you are f*cking them over planting too close, or something wrong. When they think that they have the power to talk to you like shit because they are foreman... etc
    - Well if you know i will for sure be the person that puts in 4k 3k then it helps you plan and i don't have warm up days or ooh my lunch is better then just working. i will plant trees every day knowing this type of thing will help with planning who you want in a piece. You know the most common question people ask is how long they think the contract will go... are you going to put your baller in the snarbie corner probably not it will require lot of space so, why i find is faster you are the more consistent pieces become. Rookie on some road side piece close by so can check them easier.
    - believe open, non judgement communication is the answer. Let the planters know in advance they’re allowed to tell you how they really feel and you’ll respect it. Even if they’re a bit snappy and curt , don’t take it personal. Planting is hard and we all have bad moods. Just give them space and you can always decompress once the day is done. They’re allows to protect their energy and be alone.
    Conversely , if I see a planter having a bad day who’s just sitting at the cache, don’t hover over them and remind them about quotas. It’s one thing if it’s a late day block close and everyone needs to work together , but just ask them if they want some space or some company. I feel like my crew bosses were always understanding when I needed some down time or a chill day, so I feel I have to pay it forward to my planters. If they’re chronically under performing that’s another issue , but even if in your mind you think “damn, I really wished they would finish this piece today”, its better for team cohesion in the long run to smile and say “okay, do what you need to do. Let me know if there’s anything I can do to help”
    TL;DR - establish from the start with your crew that 2 way honesty solves most every problem. Talk it out and take nothing personal
    - One little trick I like is to put sticks with flagger on them at intersections to help with directions, if you're working a large block system. That way, if you're at a contract where it may be necessary to direct people to their next piece without accompanying them, you can say things like "Walk that way, take a left at the intersection with two red flags, follow that to the turn with two blue flags, then turn right. Yours is the 2nd cache down. Your piece is on the left side of the road. Cut in straight and work left back to Sally's line."
    Obvs this is likely unnecessary on a truck access block but can be very useful in the prairie provinces, where you're likely working with quad access and bigger crews. Very helpful with making people more certain they're going the right way.
- Are are the most technical specs that you've ever had to plant?
- Once like 6 years ago now BCTS had these test plots that was a tiny fraction of the contract that needed to be planted, and I ended up being the one planting most of it. I think I was getting 6-8 cents more than the base price at the time which .28-.30 cents tree.
    - It was the strangest planting I've ever done. They were determining the effects of planting two shade trees in close proximity to a crop tree rather than obstacle planting. It was in pretty concrete rocky rips as well. Basically I would plant a crop tree in the rip which I believe was Fir, and then plant two aspen 20 cm exactly South and South West of the crop tree I just planted outside of the rip, basically making a right-angled Isosceles triangle. The hard part was if I found a good spot for the crop tree, the shade trees literally had to go in the next already determined spots based on the specs, and sometimes you would run into rock or an unplantable spot which would cause you to have to choose a new spot for the crop tree.
    - They wanted a density of 10s for the crop tree, which means 30 a plot with the shade trees since you'll also have two shade trees planted on each crop tree, which meant 6000 stems per hectare lol. I've never moved so little in a day and this ended up being pretty bad for my arms too from all the opening. I think I was only putting in 1600-1800 a day because it was more about doing a great job since these were experimental.
    - The forester came in and checked my stuff, and decided he wanted the trees in more of an "equilateral triangle" rather than right-angled Isosceles, and I asked him if he still wanted them to be 20 cm away and still South and South West facing on the crop tree which he said yes that needs to remain the same. I knew at the time that this was impossible if the orientation was to remain the same, but I wasn't about to argue triangles specifics with the forester in the middle of this experimental piece so I just said, "YOU GOT IT!!", and went right back to doing exactly what I was doing before and they ended up being super happy with it lol.
    - Most species I've planted in a day was 6 I think around Lumby up Sugar on a burn 4 years ago. Can't remember them all, but I remember the ratio that day was insane, I specifically remember it being 2% cedar so one bundle every other bag up or some shit.

- Siteik: IntermediateAktion
    - A zwischenzug (German for "intermediate move") is a chess tactic where a player, instead of making an expected move (usually a recapture), first plays an unexpected move that creates an immediate, severe threat, forcing the opponent to respond. Also known as an intermezzo, this "in-between" move often changes the situation to the player's advantage, such as winning material or avoiding a bad exchange
