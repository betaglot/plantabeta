Use AI for TagSuggestion when Tagging Video, Images or Text

## OpenCV

Use OpenCV to draw boxes around Objects in Images.

You can use OpenCV with PyTorch

## Motion Capture

## PyTorch

- Find the Average Move by combining the moves of dozens of videos. Collect video of dozens of planters performing a particular move, convert the videos into motion capture, then find the average move. Is this even possible, since the camera would need to be in the same perspective for each video, which is pretty much impossible? It would only work with CacheMoto or Moto which isn't Beta (Moto which does not interact with Land, such as BodyBend or TreeLoad)
