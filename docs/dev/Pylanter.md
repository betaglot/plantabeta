## What is Computation?

## Analogy

| Python | Plantbeta |

### Algorithm

### Data

### Input/Output

#### Return Value

Motos return force

MotoFunction

```py
def move(move{}, eco{}, via{}, neuro):
    force = (Submoto{} + Submoto{})
    return force
```

## Computational Neuroscience

## Computational Geometry

> Computational geometry is a branch of computer science devoted to the study of algorithms which can be stated in terms of geometry. Some purely geometrical problems arise out of the study of computational geometric algorithms, and such problems are also considered to be part of computational geometry.

### Graph Theory

- Nearest Neighbor
- Minimum Spanning Tree

### Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation

## Computer Science

- What are the computations that planters use?
- Just like Python, all objects in a planter's experience are objects.

## OOP

Object Oriented Programming

> A mathematical object is an abstract concept arising in mathematics. In the usual language of mathematics, an object is anything that has been (or could be) formally defined, and with which one may do deductive reasoning and mathematical proofs. Typically, a mathematical object can be a value that can be assigned to a variable, and therefore can be involved in formulas. Commonly encountered mathematical objects include numbers, sets, functions, expressions, geometric objects, transformations of other mathematical objects, and spaces. Mathematical objects can be very complex; for example, theorems, proofs, and even theories are considered as mathematical objects in proof theory.

I want to call Beta Objects Elements to align with gymnastics, since they call their Gymnast units of performance Elements. `{ Gymnastics : Plantbeta }`

All functions are Objects

A Moto is an Object of Movement

- ArmSwing()

An Eco is an Object of the Environment

- TrenchLand

A Neuro is an Object of the Nervous system

A Beta is an Object of Beta.

- Put() is a Beta
- Beta.Lingo()
    - BetaLingo is like print() or console.log()

When someone asks "What's your Beta?" you don't give them your Beta since Beta requires execution, instead you give them a description of Beta. All code is actually the movement of electricity, but it's represented as text. Really what the person is asking is "What is a description of your Beta?"

Beta can be represented as BetaCode, or BetaVox

You can't speak about Via or Moto by themselves.

An Element is an Object of Plantbeta.

- BetaElement and PlantbetaElement have been confused. Beta can be applied to Climbing, Plantbeta can not. You don't need Beta to climb. Beta is an abstraction layer on top of Climbing or Planting. Beta is the observation

- BetaScore

Beta is the method that you use, but also the communication of that method. There needs to be another word for the communication. BetaLingua

The BetaLingo of balance beam

> "<moto>Jump</moto> <via>on</via> the <eco>beam</eco> <via>at the middle</via>, then <moto>step</moto> <via>backwards</via>"

### <beta>BetaObject: Element</beta>

```py

Beta_Properties = {

```

### <eco>EcoObject: Object</eco>

```py

Eco_Properties = {
    'material': string,

}

```

### <moto>MotoObject: Moto</moto>

## Data Types

There is nothing too small to describe with code. Opening a water bottle can have a Phrase List

```py
for microsite in via:
    SpadeTest(microsite)

```

### <moto>List: Phrase</moto>

- Any Phrase

#### NeuroTuple

### String

All spoken Beta are strings

For Loop

> The for statement is used to iterate over the elements of a sequence (such as a string, tuple or list) or other iterable object:

#### MotoLoop

```py
for move in movePhrase
    Via(move)


```

#### ViaLoop

```py
for  in



```

#### NeuroLoop

- Planting Loop

```py
for  in



```

- Probe Loop

```py
for  in



```

- Microsite Selection Loop

```py
for microsite in via:
    SpadeTest(microsite)

```

- Counting Loop

```py
for seedling in bag:
    count++


```

- Unwrap Loop

```py
while Bundle_Is_Wrapped = True:
    BundlePeel()


```

- Cache Construct Loop

```py

#### NeuroFunction()

- Area.BoustroCover

<!-- What are the Functions of Via? -->

- is Via

## Expression

### MotoExpression

The coverage control is a multi-agent system control method that governs agents to move toward the optimal placement based on a predetermined density function. Many applications of coverage control have been reported in many fields, such as

- In the future shrubs will be planted among crop trees to prevent soil erosion.
- In northern Alberta they plant Rhododendron Shrubs (locally known as Labrador Tea)
