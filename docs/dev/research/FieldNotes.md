# FieldNotes

- Crystalize information into a form
- Cache Break doesn't need to be called a break
- Tie Boots Fully
- (ShadePlanting != ObstaclePlanting)
    - Plant the North Side of Shader
- Instructor Plant with novices. Beside them, not just in the same piece
- Taking Plots us a time for observation. Observe what?
    - In hindsight, what didn't you need to be flagged?
    - Take pictures of flag to show where they end up
    - All the different ways that flag remains fixed both on purpose and by wind
    - Take a picture of every tree of a bag up. Use different FlagColor. To link to each PlantaCycle
- 1.06
    - Boustro to simplify perpendicular instead of walking over tree
- 1.07
    - Insert Flag LooseEnd medial and up
- 1.08
    - Throw your spade over a high obstacle so you can use two hands to climb
    - RockCap has few places for flag to snag
- 1.09
    - Layering is like Reving your engine.
        - Shifting up or down
        - RPM = Energy
        - Thermal Energy
    - Step Down into trench sideways to prevent knee over toes, otherwise HeelKrampon step becuase of stiff boot

    - You stop paying attention to the spade during the moton, when planting with non dominant side. MotorControl requires attention. Dominant side has more developed attention hooks
        - <BC l='Spade's='NonDominant'e=''v=''m=''a='Attention'/>
        - You must adapt to how the ‚≠ê<labor>Spade</labor> is moving.

                    - Control = "Following a üîª<via>line</via>"
    - Motor can require AnimaInhibition.
        - "Quiet the mind"
        - "Stop thinking", "discursive thoughts"
        - Focus can be about (Exclusion = NOT Excessive Inclusion)

- 1.20
    - MarkumDev
        - Block boundary flag becomes difficult to see when its color is sun faded, which leads to trespassing
    - Start your [Poales.Skreef,Skim] closest to roots
- 1.21
    - Cross Sectional Diagram of Poales
            - C negates te necessity for A

            - Load Neons to evenly distribute weight between both sides
                - It's easier to walk with evenly distributed Neons and WalkInPieceCache has more walking with full bags than PlantInPieceCache
                    - Kuboi of Injury
- 2.09
    - Taking a step closer to hole is less Kuboi than stepping backwards, since you can see the [Boot,Anterior,Ekos]  of your Boots, but not the <BC l='Boot's='Posterior'e='EKOS'v=''m=''a=''/>
        - üî∑<soma>Anterior</soma> is a Space relative to SOMA, not a üîª<via>Direction</via>

    - BetumArray
    - Wipe both your hands before reaching for this book. Soiled paper is more difficult to read
- 2.12
    - Lunge SpadeSlam is more powerful, but should only be used when both Feet are at the same elevation when lunging, ie. not lunging up or down a slope.
- 2.13
    - Don't plant like a how athletes ride half pipes.
        - VION("Walk up and down Slope")
            - Proposition
    - Definitions don't have proofs
- 2.14
    - <BC l='Boot's='Skreef'e=''v=''m='Rasp'a=''/> has no impact, unlike <BC l='Boot's='Skreef'e=''v=''m='Kick'a=''/>
    - Bellows unfold from ChestPack then attach to waist belt
    - If a Rock or hole DeflectingObstacle rotates the Blade onKontakt, then KorpoOrbit around Spade until Shoulders are SquaredUp with Spade
        - Adapt your position relative to Spade, since the üü©<ekos>Soil</ekos> constrains BladePosition more than SOMA
