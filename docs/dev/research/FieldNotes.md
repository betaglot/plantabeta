# FieldNotes

- Crystalize information into a form
- Cache Break doesn't need to be called a break
- Tie Boots Fully
- (ShadePlanting != ObstaclePlanting)
    - Plant the North Side of Shader
- Instructor Plant with novices. Beside them, not just in the same piece
- Taking Plots us a time for observation. Observe what?
    - In hindsight, what didn't you need to be flagged?
    - Take pictures of flag to show where they end up
    - All the different ways that flag remains fixed both on purpose and by wind
    - Take a picture of every tree of a bag up. Use different FlagColor. To link to each PlantaCycle
- 1.06
    - Boustro to simplify perpendicular instead of walking over tree
- 1.07
    - Insert Flag LooseEnd medial and up
- 1.08
    - Throw your spade over a high obstacle so you can use two hands to climb
    - RockCap has few places for flag to snag
- 1.09
    - Layering is like Reving your engine.
        - Shifting up or down
        - RPM = Energy
        - Thermal Energy
    - Step Down into trench sideways to prevent knee over toes, otherwise HeelKrampon step becuase of stiff boot
        - ‚≠ê<labor>Boot</labor>

    - Bounce, Cross, Zone, Follow
        - Your four options when you converge with another plantor

    - Triangle made from straight lines. Like a 3D printer
        - 3D printer algorithms are like fill algorithms.
            - Get(Open Source Completion Algorithms)

    - "Bring up the line"
    - "Brought up the line"
    - "Brought the line up to [Ekon || Vion]"
    - Synonym("Hit" = Interact)
        - "Hit a line"
        - "Hit a boundary"
        - "I hit trees, so I turned back"
        - "Hit a road"
        - "Hit an [Ekon || Vion]"
- 1.14
    - Rip apart during NeonInsert. Trees that are attached by an intrusive root, can be ripped apart during NeonInsert instead of as separate Betum
    - Planting 15s is like planting a myriad or "a lot"
        - Superlative Density
        - Maximum Practical Density
            - PRAKTIK
- 1.15
    - You stop paying attention to the spade during the moton, when planting with non dominant side. MotorControl requires attention. Dominant side has more developed attention hooks
        - <BC l='Spade's='NonDominant'e=''v=''m=''a='Attention'/>
        - You must adapt to how the ‚≠ê<labor>Spade</labor> is moving.  
            - Guide
            - Herd (verb)
            - Affordance
                - "Able to get it back under control if I do this moton"
                    - Control = "Following a üîª<via>line</via>"
    - Motor can require AnimaInhibition.
        - "Quiet the mind"
        - "Stop thinking", "discursive thoughts"
        - Focus can be about (Exclusion = NOT Excessive Inclusion)

    - Betum = Tuple

        - Middle Plantor follows Zone.Midline
        - Flankers do <via>FillPattern(ZigZagLine)</via>

    - First submoton of Klose gathers, then secon Moton Stamps
        - Gather then Kompakt
    - <BC l='(Spade, Boot.Rand)'s=''e=''v=''m='Purga'a=''/>
        - [Rand, Purga.Scrape] along SpadeEdge
        - SpadeProp.Vertical to keep Spade Stationary
- 1.20
    - MarkumDev
        - Block boundary flag becomes difficult to see when its color is sun faded, which leads to trespassing
    - Start your [Poales.Skreef,Skim] closest to roots
- 1.21
    - Cross Sectional Diagram of Poales
            - C negates te necessity for A  
        - To cut the Poales once medially, instead of once distally and another medially
            - ReduceRedundancy
- 1.22
    - Diagram of IKON Label
    - Dynamic or Static
    - Use Slots to input number
        - Numbered Ikon

    - Blinding yourself with the sun each time you look for the drip line
    - <BC l='Spade's=''e=''v=''m='Pry.PalmPush'a=''/>
        - Open Hand in to PalmPush to avoid hitting an Ekon with your knuckles
        - like closing a drawer
        - Don't allow anything (Labon,Somon,Ekon) to curl over edge
