# AfternoonTask

In the afternoon it can be difficult to pay attention and it's not possible to consume caffeine to increase attention, so the best use of afternoon time is to explore. Explore and save what you found in Keep.

A MorningTask is one  which requires high levels of concentration and where there is a clear goal. 

## Task: Exploratory Learning

Follow Rabbit holes, turn up the curiosity, there is no definite place to get to, just wander around the topic to familiarize yourself with it.

::: danger Danger: Instagram

Avoid <strong>Instagram</strong> during explorations, since it is designed to waste time and every person younger than me is an "expert" in Instagram so I don't need to become one. Once Plantbeta has more content, then I'll delegate Instagram posting and networking to someone who actually enjoys it. Instagram definitely messed up my sleep and pulled me offcourse during my first attempt to gain support.

::: tip [OpenSource](/dev/)
Open Source is the most important thing to understand for Plantbeta's growth and implementation. I need to become an expert. Play the wikipedia game.

- Laravel
- D3.js
- Python
- Vue
- Geomatics
- HubermanLab website
    - Figure out how they are coding the timestamps


## Task: Documentation Design Research

Crop or label screenshots of these sites, currently Plantbeta is just documentation.

See what works and straight up copy when general enough, they're all open source anyway. 

Look at the documentation for these sites:

## Task: Forestry in BC Research

- I need to have at least some understanding about how the planting industry works, especially how the financials work since Plantbeta will cost something to implement. 

- Learning more about the silviculture industry will give ideas about how to convince planters and companies to want Plantbeta

- Find other groups who are doing the similar things to Plantbeta, such as [Flash Forest](https://flashforest.ca/).

## Task: Explore Plantbeta

- **Add PaperPhotos** to each page. So much of Plantbeta has already been created on paper and in my mind, the goal now is just to get all of that information into Plantbeta so that it can be used in the upcoming planting seasons.

- Test UI and UX


## Task: Patagonia

- Learn about the projects that they collaborate with.
- Learn the names of the people in charge of Action
- Find products which can be modified into [Planter Tools](/dev/Tools)
