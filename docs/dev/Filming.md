## Audio

## Clapboard

Use a small whiteboard like a clapboard to reference notes to specific trees

- Planter

Example you find something that you want to comment on, so you shoe the camera a number or some kind of identifier then you also reference it in your audio and later text

Hold the board close to the camera so that it can be easily found during the editing process.
