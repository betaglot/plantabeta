## <dev>With</dev> <beta>BETAKROME</beta>

### <dev>Day1</dev>

- <labor>Morning</labor> is spent, mainly <anima>talking</anima>, and <motor>equipment fitting</motor>. <dev>Probably</dev> in this order

    1. <anima>safety</anima>
    2. <motor>ergonomics</motor>
    3. logistics
    4. <motor>technique</motor>
    5. <labor>quality</labor>

- <labor>Taking the better part of 1-2 hours to cover that and demo that through the <ekos>land</ekos>.</labor>
- Then <dev>I would cut them into <labor>small cuts of land</labor></dev>, no more than <labor>100m</labor>. and <dev>ideally</dev> a <labor>cattle plant or group of 3</labor>.
- <labor>Bag ups of 30-40 (2-3 bundles)</labor> and <dev>to really emphasize</dev> the <anima>practice</anima> of <motor>good technique</motor> and <labor>good quality</labor>.
- Then <via>bagging out in the back</via> and <motor>quality checking</motor> <labor>their own, and each others work</labor> as <beta>they</beta> <via>head back</via>
    - <labor>Minimum 6-8 <motor>plots</motor> per bag</labor>
- for me day 1 should be between 80 - 160 trees, <labor>nothing crazy</labor>, just trying to  <anima>understand</anima> the <motor>movements</motor>, and the <labor>specs</labor>.

### <dev>Day2</dev>

- <anima>Recap</anima> of <labor>day 1</labor>, <anima>reminders of missteps or things to work on</anima>.
- then <dev>cut them loose</dev> with the <labor>intent to do 8 bagups</labor>, with <labor>less than an hour turn around</labor>.
and to have a <labor>quality</labor>, <motor>ergonomic</motor> and logistic <anima>focus</anima>.
- <dev>Trying to get them to understand</dev>
    - <via>how to keep a clean line in</via>
    - <via>an organized back line</via>
    - <dev>build on</dev> <via>triangle planting</via> (the tree before last, this tree, the next one)
- <labor>Aimed quota for 160-340</labor>

- For me I really don't mind low production in the <anima>learning stage</anima>, the speed comes with <anima>understanding</anima> of <beta>planting</beta>.

### <dev>Day3</dev>

- Try to give an opportunity for <beta>them</beta> to be in their own <labor>piece</labor>
- by now <beta>they</beta> should <anima>understand</anima>
    - <anima>looking for trees</anima>
    - <via>following a line and boundary</via>
    - <labor>the difference between good and bad trees.</labor>
- Increase the production, add a bundle or two per bag up and try to keep those cache breaks down to less than 8 minutes, and to actually hit 8 bagups (most get hung up on day2 about doing a certain amount every bag up, instead of just getting a bag done, even if it's half the amount)

- I would say by their 10th day planting if <beta>they</beta> are at 1400 in raw, <beta>they</beta>'re in a good spot. Incrementing up to it by ~200 trees a day (2 bundles extra/bag)
- <beta>They</beta> set themselves up to be a really quality <beta>planter</beta> with some longevity.

### <dev>The gist</dev>

- You can tell a rookie everything <beta>they</beta> need to know, but <beta>they</beta> won't succeed until <beta>they</beta> understand.
- I find explaining why goes a long way, and allows them to use their head a bit more.
Learning in <ekos>raw</ekos> is by far the <beta>easiest</beta>, then <ekos>prep</ekos>, then <ekos>fill</ekos>.

- Keep it as <anima>simple</anima> as possible, and no more than 3 <anima>major focuses</anima>/day (spec wise) with this too, their quantity is so low and <beta>they</beta> should be checking so much it should really be great
