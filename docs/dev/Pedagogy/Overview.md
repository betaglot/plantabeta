# Pedagogy

Learn by recall instead of trial and error

Rookie Stare isn't experienced as Vision

Do you remember everything

Does all the knowledge that you finished your last season with remain when you start your next season?

How would you even know?

Wouldn't it be nice to know what you've forgotten. If you could take a test to find out, would you take it?

## Tutorials

## VideoGame

PurposeGames.com

Use Instruments that GenZ is already addicted to. Many PotentialPlanters are young adults who are addicted to playing video games. Create a video game which teaches PlantaBeta so Planters can increase their planting knowledge before the season starts.

It's ok if the game is boring if you're being paid to play it.

## CurseOfKnowledge

The best way to reduce the CurseOfKnowledge is to check the user's knowledge frequently. Asking if the user has questions is not enough, because the user may not even have enough knowledge to ask a question.

- Does that make sense?
- Do you understand?
- Paraphrase what I just said.
    - Users really know something when it becomes encoded in Mentalese. Only Mentalese can produce a paraphrase.

### UI ToReduceCurseOfKnowledge

- Instrumenttips like Wikipedia On(Hover)

## Skreefing Lesson

Use the sand at 10cm below surface for SpadeSkreef, since it's a similar density to the soil on the block, unlike the loose dry surface sand.

## Pacer

Use an ExperiencedPlanter to act as a Pacer for NovicePlanters. To show the speed goal speed. Be sure that the Pacer isn't competing with the Novices, that is, the Pacer must not try to constantly go faster than the novices.

## Send in your work to be Evaluated

Submit image of drawing for testing

- Draw a BetaDiagram

## Video Analysis

To understand what's going on in the Planter video

### VideoLabelling

- Anti-pedagogy
    - Some Planters are fringe or counter-culture, which often leads to a dislike of any schooling.
    - Planters who are Dyslexic
    - Planters
    - "when will I ever use this in my life?" is always null in PlantaBeta, literally every piece of information is designed to contribute to Planter's profit 💲🤑💸💰.

- ShortTerm Gain instead of LongTerm Gain
- Traditionalism
    - "This is how we've always done things so why change"
