## What is PlantaBeta?

### Why are there brackets?

A mathematical function

Remember f(x) = 2x ?

## What do the icons mean?

<span class="beta">Beta</span>: The system used to prescribe or describe a Planter's experience.

"beta" comes from climbing. It is any information about how to climb something. The term beta is an abbreviation of Betamax, which was hardware used to record video, like a VHS cassette tape 📼. Before the internet climbers would give each other Betamax video tapes of climbs, so if you wanted to see a video of climb was performed you would ask for the "Beta". Although people no longer use tapes 📼, the term is still used in climbing all the time and is sometimes used in other mountain sports, such as, mountain biking and skiing.

Beta is composed of four types, each of which can be represented by an icon:

🟩<span class="ekos">EKOS </span>: All biologic and geologic objects and processes you interact with while in a planting block. For example: slash, roads, stumps, plants, soil and weather.

🟠<span class="motor">MOTON </span>: The movements and Instruments you use to plant trees. For example: slamming your spade into the ground, ripping Markum, your clothing and your bags.

🔻<span class="via">VIA </span>: The path taken by Planters. For example: your line in, backfilling, area planting, bouncing while partner planting and deadwalking

💜<span class="anima">ANIMA </span>: Any phenonmena of your nervous system, includes emotion, thought, perception, awareness, attention and more.  

## How am I supposed to use PlantaBeta.ca?

### The Guide Section

### The Examples Section

### The Reference Section

### The Tutorial Section

### The App (🔷) Section

### The Development (🛠) Section

### Examples

- 🟩<span class="ekos">Soil</span>: Duff mixed with soil is ok if it is smearable, meaning that the soil sticks together when smeared.
    - Coherent

- 🟩<span class="ekos">CullTree</span>: Put CullTrees in Duff instead of sidebag.

- 🟩<span class="ekos">SoilSound</span>: Muffled Soil has lots more organic matter to absorb sound. Rock is louder than organic matter due to the strength of rock's lattice structure.

- 🟠<span class="motor">Clothing</span>: Don't leave stuff in backbag when wet.
    - Cotton mold

- 🟠<span class="motor">BundleMano</span>: Grab two bundles in each hand, so four bundles at a time when transfering bundles from boxes to bags.

- 🟠<span class="motor">TreeTest.Error</span>: One tree test and what are you looking for?
    - 💜<span class="anima">FearOfReplant</span>

- 🟠<span class="motor">TreeTest</span>: Single MOTON for TreeTest

- 🟠<span class="motor">SpadeImpact</span>: Humerus Rotate Out for SpadeImpact to recruit Latissimus Dorsi and prevent overactivation of Pectoralis muscles which causes Shoulder Impingement Injury

- 🟠<span class="motor">SpadeSkreef</span>: SpadeSkreef is faster than BootSkreef or HandSkreef. And it flows into the retrokurve of SpadeImpact.

- 🟠<span class="motor">TraverseBush</span>: Spread branches while pushing your way through a bush.
    - AlderCluster, MapleCluster

- 🔻<span class="via">Walkout</span>: Walkout using the most direct path unless there's a road, skidder trail or clear path near.
    - The PathOfLeastResistance is sometimes faster than ShortestPath

- 🔻<span class="via">Cover-❌<error>Error</error></span>: FrontFilling is when there are trees between the cache and Piece.BackBoundary

- 🔻<span class="via">VIA-❌<error>Error</error></span>: Don't walk up and down slope, only up and across slope, during BoustroCover and ZigzagCover.

- 🔻<span class="via">Markate</span>: Only Markate the "zag" of ZigzagCover.

- 🔻<span class="via">⭐<span class="labor">Marka</span>-❌<error>Error</error></span>: Attempt to high Marka in fill plants whenever possible. The Marka may fall to the ground, but it's worth taking the chance since a high Marka is more valuable than the time wasted from a HighMarka Fail.

- <span class="beta">Lesson</span>: Point out Mikrosites so Planter can work on walking speed while not thinking about SiteSelection
    - Isolate Elements, Isolate Skills. Decompose Elements into subelements then instruct them in isolation.

- <span class="beta">Lesson</span>: Follow the instructor. Follow the instructor while they plant. Instructor can make error on purpose to test student's 💜<span class="anima">ErrorDetection</span> ability. You integrate information more deeply when teaching it, students become teachers in this lesson.

- <span class="beta">Instruction</span>: Let Planter get in the groove before observing
    - CurrentSite, AnteSite, PostSite are NOT NULL is more realistic than one tree at a time.

- <span class="beta">Instruction</span>: CurseOfKnowledge. Instructors can take for granted their knowledge. When using jargon for the first few times, remember to explain to student what it means.

- <span class="beta">Instruction</span>: Only ask for an answer to a question that students could plausibly know. Apriori will only cause frustration and can easily become condescending.

- <span class="beta">Instruction</span>: So there isn't resistance, set the intentions of student by asking questions like "Do you want to plant as fast as possible?", "Why are we doing this lesson?", " Why did you come planting?"
