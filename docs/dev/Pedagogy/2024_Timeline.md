# 2024 Timeline

## Day 1:

### 8-10

- health and safety stuff

### 10-10:30

- Kurt had us each plant 1 tree in the ground. Never mentioned once how to throw the shovel properly.
- Went over J roots and what makes a tree straight.
- We stood there and planted the same tree like 3-5 times, then had to show Jess and Kurt that we could do it correctly.
- Showed us how to flag.

### 10:30-11

- Jess used the whiteboard to draw up what a density is.
- Explained in theory what a plot was (never showed us with the cord)

### 11-2  

- we were given our own “pieces” we bagged like 50 trees each so they told us to deadwalk into the back and start planting.
- Spent the rest of the day planting maybe 150 trees

## Day 2:

### 8-1

- we spent going through each rookies pieces and taking plots.
- We went through why each tree was good or bad, and how to properly take plots.
- Obviously the pieces were all shit shows, and some of the rookies said that they felt this was embarrassing to have other people critique their pieces. I personally think that this was the best thing they did in the rookie training, because I had no clue what they wanted in a good tree until this.
- This was also the first time they explained picking a microsite to us, which I found really helpful (but I would’ve probably found it more helpful if taught day 1)

### 1-4

- was us just going through and fixing our pieces

## Day 3

- normal day of planting.
- We just worked our pieces, and Kurt and Jess were going through to make sure they were decent enough to pass.
- I’m pretty sure that most of us finished our pieces on this day

## 🌈<beta>BETA</beta>

### ⭐<labor>LABOR</labor>

- Maybe 600-750 tops. I think I planted like 800 total the first 3 days and I did one bag up in a different piece
- J roots and what makes a tree straight

### 🔷<soma>SOMA</soma>

### 🟩<ekos>EKOS</ekos>

- I remember the land as being really shitty, but I think that’s because I had no clue what I was doing.
- It had trenches in the front, a bit of a slope in the middle which was raw, then raw at the top which was rock cap.

### 🔻<via>VIA</via>

- I’m not even sure if there was that much rock cap.
- They didn’t explain to us how to go around obstacles so I think I spent most of my time trying to find places to plant in the rock caps and slash piles
- told us to deadwalk into the back and start planting
