# üõ† DX: Developer Experience

::: tip Difference Between Developer and Writer

A developer creates code and a writer creates the text presented to the planters.

:::

## Python

- Shrubbery.py

## Content Writing

Content can be written outside of VScode, then inserted later.


### Dictation

Dictation will be performed at Arch Street, so the setup is a large TV, laptop, phone

#### DictationError
```py

Homonyms = {
    'cash': 'cache',
    'narrow': 'neuro',
    '/': 'slash',
    'planetary': 'planter',
    'Roland': 'RawLand',
    'Rollins': 'RawLand',
    'screaming': 'screefing',
    'Jay root': 'Jroot' 
}

```

#### Dictation Formatting

- $ "*dollar*" to denote a paragraph

```md

- 
```

- . "*dot*" for period

#### Dictation Phrase

0. SetUp Laptop with Plantbeta open on left half and the google doc open on the right. Record the audio with your phone being held up close to your mouth. 

1. Look at the Page, Tags and the PaperPhotos in <dev>DesignBox</dev> . 
    - Think of something to say for each header. Say the header that you're thinking about, eg. "Subelements", "Related Elements", "Element Properties", "Definition"...etc
    - Say period, new line, 


2. Record the audio in a Google Doc until you can't think of anything else to say.
    - Make sure that you're enunciating
    - Use Plantbeta terminology, don't worry about grammar
    - Glance at the text, but don't read it. Sometimes the recording stops.

3. Paste Raw output into VScode Parse the output by adding empty lines between parts

- How to use Python to process the raw dictation?
- Make each dictation into a string 
    - str.replace() homonyms, AlsoKnownAs, Common Errors 

4. Rephrase and correct grammar
    - Add punctuation
    - Capitalize
    - Replace homonyms
5. Insert into the body of the page, formatted according to [StyleGuide](/dev/StyleGuide)
    - Replace with 'Dictation1' in Design Box after insertion (so you don't find it again in next step)

6. Search for empty design box to find the next page to dictate (there's about 360 left to go, approx 60 hours or work)

```

::: tip 
Complete all the steps each day to refine your process. For instance after parsing today I realized that for postcedent dictations I need to create new lines and punctuation.

### PaperMine

Use images and video when describing all the properties of an element. 

Look at a Spade while listing out all the properties of the spade instead of using a mental image. Concrete is less cognitively demanding. There is very little creativity when listing properties, they're just facts.

### TagSpaces

Use TagSpaces to 

Convert the list of Papers associated with a given tag into a markdown photos


```py

PaperList = []

for Paper in PaperPhotoList:
    print(f'## {Paper}')
    print(f'![PaperPhoto](/PaperPhoto/{Paper})')

```
### Planting Videos

## Frontend

### Markdown

### Vue

## Backend

## Typescript

### Database

### Hosting

## VSCode

### Extensions

```md

```

## List all Files in a directory
```sh
find -type f -print0 | xargs -0 ls -t
```

## <neuro>WTF is going on?</neuro>

It's ok to be confused by your own work. Complex systems don't start off being coherent. 

**Trust your visions**, just because I'm not explaining things well and I'm improvising, doesn't mean that the work is incorrect.

Work at different scopes. You're not going to be able to explain the big picture well if you don't know the details. The details are the individual pages of elements.

::: tip Coherence
Coherence is developed

> the situation when the parts of something fit together in a natural or reasonable way

### <neuro> ‚ÄúI looked forward to another 500 pounds of squat. I looked forward to doing more and more curls until my arms would fall off. Why? Because I knew that every rep that I did and every set that I did and more weights that I lifted, I get one step closer to turning that **vision** into reality.‚Äù</neuro>

You're not making it worse, each workblock makes it better, deciding that what you wrote needs to be changed is an improvement. Finding out what doesn't work is a form of improvement. Plantbeta is a really difficult project, **expect to feel its difficulties!**

Just get as much information out of your head and into data structures, so that they can be processed.

<move>Keep going!!!</move>
