# üõ† Open Source Project

> Open-source software is computer software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose. Open-source software may be developed in a collaborative, public manner.

> Open source software is managed as ‚Äúprojects‚Äù that are focused on creating a particular piece of software that is distributed as a ‚Äúlibrary‚Äù or application. Some projects are staffed by volunteers who are collectively referred to as the ‚Äúcommunity‚Äù for that project. The developers working on a project are called ‚Äúcontributors‚Äù to the project. We call this model, Community-driven open-source software [CDOSS]. Sometimes a project is driven by a company that has a need for the software but does not feel it needs exclusive access to the software. In that case some of the developers working on the project are paid employees of that company. Typically other interested developers are allowed to contribute to the effort on a voluntary basis. We call this model company-backed open source software [CBOSS].

## Transparency

## No Cost

## Accessible

## Open Minded

- Having an open mind is important to open source projects. It doesn't matter who created or developed an idea, it only matters if the idea is good for Put(Plant).

- Python

## [Real Python](/dev/RealPython)

## Put(Plant) is built with these Open Source Projects

- Vue.js
- Python
- Typescript
- D3.js
- Markdown
- SQLite

## DevNotes

- The Beta is the OpenSource

- Mostly about the documentation, since planters will be implementing putplant.py physically instead of electronically.

- How much do I explain and how much do I just leave to the open source organizations' websites, which are way more developed? What do people need to know about Open Source to see its value to humanity  

## DevState

```py
`TagsToHeaders: False`
```

- A moral argument for planter optimization
    - Help these poor kids
    - Rich old mother grandmother
