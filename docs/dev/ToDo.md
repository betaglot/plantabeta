## Add Green Notebook to DesignBox

Add the information about Put(Plant) to the website.

Add with PinkInk before PaperPhoto. PaperPhoto is more for reference than  

### Task Hardware

- PinkInk
- Notebook
- Laptop

### 1. Add PaperIndex to each Paper

Search Drive to find that number to start the index

### 2. PaperPhoto

PaperPhoto before or After PinkInk? It's more important to get the information from the notebook than to record the notebook's papers.

- Add PaperPhotos to Repo

### 3. PaperTag

- Tag with TagSpaces

## Translate Tags to Headers

### Task Hardware

- 2 screens so you can see PaperPhotos while coding

### Task Sequence

Go TopDown through the directories

Look at the PaperPhoto section to have a better idea of what the Tag represents

1. Start with the Module Overviews
    - Some of the tags in the overview will become their own Pages.
    - **Remember to transfer the PaperPhotos to the new page too**
2. MotoPages
3. ViaPages
4. NeuroPages
5. BetaPages

```py
TagsToHeaders: True
```

Update to `True` once completed

<!-- ## <s>Add Tags to each Page's Design Box</s>

1. Make dict `PageNamespace: [TagName]`
    - PagePathAndTags.json
2. Copy all Tags from PagePathAndTags.json to each Page
    - Make a script which puts all the tags into code boxes which can be copied
 -->

<!-- ## Add PaperPhoto to <dev>DesignBox</dev>

1. <s>Make dict `PageNamespace: [TagName]`</s>

2. <s> Make dict `PaperPhoto: [TagName]`</s>

3. <s>Make a dict `PageNamespace: [PaperPhoto]`</s> -->

## Add PaperText to <dev>DesignBox</dev>

::: tip

PaperText is most useful for fine details. It should be done after Dictation and after DesignBox to Headers.

:::

1. Get Put(Plant)PaperText
    - Find most recent PaperText
    - Upload PaperText to SQlite
    - Select of all the PaperText which has a PaperPhoto in Put(Plant)'s repo
