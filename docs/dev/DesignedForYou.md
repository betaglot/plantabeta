A game which is designed to simulate being a planter.

To test

Plantbeta is a system to define the rules of the game.

## What do the icons mean?

🔷<beta>Beta</beta>: The system used to prescribe or describe a planter's experience. Beta is composed of four factors, each of which can be represented by an icon:

🟩<eco>Eco Factor</eco>: All the biologic and geologic objects and processes in a planting block. For example, slash, roads, stumps, plants, soil, weather.

🟠<moto>Moto Factor</moto>: The movements performed by planters.

🔻<via>Via Factor</via>: The path taken by planters.

💜<neuro>Neuro Factor</neuro>: Phenonmena of the nervous system. Includes thought, perception, awareness, attention and more.  

## Betaglot

## How am I supposed to use putplant.ca?

### Examples

- 🟠<moto>Clothing</moto>: Don't leave stuff in backbag when wet.
    - Cotton mold
- 🟠<moto>BundleGrip</moto>: Grab two bundles in each hand, so four bundles at a time when transfering bundles from boxes to bags.
- 🔷<beta>Instruction</beta>: Let Planter get in the groove before observing
    - CurrentSite, AnteSite, PostSite are NOT NULL is more realistic than one tree at a time.
- 🟠<moto>TreeTest.Error</moto>: One tree test and what are you looking for?
    - 💜<neuro>FearOfReplant</neuro>
- 🟩<eco>Soil</eco>: Duff mixed with soil is ok if it is smearable, meaning that the soil sticks together when smeared.
    - Coherent
- 🟠<moto>TreeTest</moto>: Single Moto for TreeTest
- 🟠<moto>SpadeSlam</moto>: Humerus Rotate Out for SpadeSlam to recruit Latissimus Dorsi and prevent overactivation of Pectoralis muscles which causes Shoulder Impingement Injury
- 🟩<eco>CullTree</eco>: Put CullTrees in Duff instead of sidebag.
- 🔻<via>CoverError</via>: FrontFilling is when there are trees between the cache and backline
- 🟠<moto>SpadeScreef</moto>: SpadeScreef is faster than BootScreef or HandScreef. And it flows into the backswing of SpadeSlam.
- 🟠<moto>SpadeSlam</moto>: Wrestling Snap down is SpadeSlam. Like Rope Climbing.
- 🔻<via>Walkout</via>: Walkout using the most direct path unless there's a road, skidder trail or clear path near.
    - The PathOfLeastResistance is sometimes faster than ShortestPath
- 🔷<beta>Lesson</beta>: Point out microsites so planter can work on walking speed while not thinking about SiteSelection
    - Isolate Elements, Isolate Skills. Decompose Elements into subelements then instruct them in isolation.
- 🟠<moto>TraverseBush</moto>: Spread branches while pushing your way through a bush.
    - AlderCluster, MapleCluster
- 🟩<eco>SoilSound</eco>: Muffled Soil has lots more organic matter to absorb sound. Rock is louder than organic matter due to the strength of rock's lattice structure.
- 🔷<beta>Lesson</beta>: Follow the instructor. Follow the instructor while they plant. Instructor can make error on purpose to test student's 💜<neuro>ErrorDetection</neuro> ability. You integrate information more deeply when teaching it, students become teachers in this lesson.
- 🔷<beta>Instruction</beta>: CurseOfKnowledge. Instructors can take for granted their knowledge. When using jargon for the first few times, remember to explain to student what it means.
- 🔻<via>ViaError</via>: Don't walk up and down slope, only up and across slope, during BoustroCover and ZigzagCover.
- 🔻<via>Flag</via>: Only flag the "zag" of ZigzagCover.
- 🔷<beta>Instruction</beta>: So there isn't resistance, set the intentions of student by asking questions like "Do you want to plant as fast as possible?", "Why are we doing this lesson?", " Why did you come planting?"
- 🔻<via>FlagError</via>: Attempt to high flag in fill plants whenever possible. The flag may fall to the ground, but it's worth taking the chance since a high flag is more valuable than the time wasted from a HighFlag Fail.
- 🔷<beta>Instruction</beta>: Only ask for an answer to a question that students could plausibly know. Apriori will only cause frustration and can easily become condescending.
