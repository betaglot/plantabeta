## What is PlantaBeta?

### Why are there brackets?

A mathematical function

Remember f(x) = 2x ?

## What do the icons mean?

🔷<beta>Beta</beta>: The system used to prescribe or describe a plantor's experience.

"beta" comes from climbing. It is any information about how to climb something. The term beta is an abbreviation of Betamax, which was hardware used to record video, like a VHS cassette tape 📼. Before the internet climbers would give each other Betamax video tapes of climbs, so if you wanted to see a video of climb was performed you would ask for the "Beta". Although people no longer use tapes 📼, the term is still used in climbing all the time and is sometimes used in other mountain sports, such as, mountain biking and skiing.

Beta is composed of four types, each of which can be represented by an icon:

🟩<eko>Eko </eko>: All biologic and geologic objects and processes you interact with while in a planting block. For example: slash, roads, stumps, plants, soil and weather.

🟠<move>Move </move>: The movements and tools you use to plant trees. For example: slamming your spade into the ground, ripping Marka, your clothing and your bags.

🔻<via>Via </via>: The path taken by plantors. For example: your line in, backfilling, area planting, bouncing while partner planting and deadwalking

💜<psike>Psike </psike>: Any phenonmena of your nervous system, includes emotion, thought, perception, awareness, attention and more.  

## How am I supposed to use putplant.ca?

### The Examples Section

### The Reference Section

### The Tutorial Section

### The App (🔷) Section

### The Development (🛠) Section

### Examples

- 🟩<eko>[Soil](/encyclopedia/Eko/Soil/Overview)</eko>: Duff mixed with soil is ok if it is smearable, meaning that the soil sticks together when smeared.
    - Coherent

- 🟩<eko>[CullTree](/encyclopedia/Eko/Seedling/Overview)</eko>: Put CullTrees in Duff instead of sidebag.

- 🟩<eko>[SoilSound](/encyclopedia/Eko/Soil/Overview)</eko>: Muffled Soil has lots more organic matter to absorb sound. Rock is louder than organic matter due to the strength of rock's lattice structure.

- 🟠<move>[Clothing](/encyclopedia/Move/ClothingMove/Overview)</move>: Don't leave stuff in backbag when wet.
    - Cotton mold

- 🟠<move>[BundleGrip](/encyclopedia/Move/ToolMove/Bundle/BundleGrip)</move>: Grab two bundles in each hand, so four bundles at a time when transfering bundles from boxes to bags.

- 🟠<move>[TreeTest.Error](/encyclopedia/Move/HandMove/TreeTest)</move>: One tree test and what are you looking for?
    - 💜<psike>FearOfReplant</psike>

- 🟠<move>[TreeTest](/encyclopedia/Move/HandMove/TreeTest)</move>: Single Move for TreeTest

- 🟠<move>[SpadeSlam](/encyclopedia/Move/ToolMove/Spade/SpadeSlam)</move>: Humerus Rotate Out for SpadeSlam to recruit Latissimus Dorsi and prevent overactivation of Pectoralis muscles which causes Shoulder Impingement Injury

- 🟠<move>[SpadeSkreef](/encyclopedia/Move/ToolMove/Spade/SpadeSkreef)</move>: SpadeSkreef is faster than BootSkreef or HandSkreef. And it flows into the backswing of SpadeSlam.

- 🟠<move>[TraverseBush](/encyclopedia/Move/PlantMove/Overview)</move>: Spread branches while pushing your way through a bush.
    - AlderCluster, MapleCluster

- 🔻<via>[Walkout](/encyclopedia/Via/Path/Overview)</via>: Walkout using the most direct path unless there's a road, skidder trail or clear path near.
    - The PathOfLeastResistance is sometimes faster than ShortestPath

- 🔻<via>[CoverError](/encyclopedia/Via/)</via>: FrontFilling is when there are trees between the cache and backline

- 🔻<via>[ViaError](/encyclopedia/Via/)</via>: Don't walk up and down slope, only up and across slope, during BoustroCover and ZigzagCover.

- 🔻<via>[Marka](/encyclopedia/Via/)</via>: Only Marka the "zag" of ZigzagCover.

- 🔻<via>[MarkaError](/encyclopedia/Via/)</via>: Attempt to high Marka in fill plants whenever possible. The Marka may fall to the ground, but it's worth taking the chance since a high Marka is more valuable than the time wasted from a HighMarka Fail.

- 🔷<beta>Lesson</beta>: Point out microsites so plantor can work on walking speed while not thinking about SiteSelection
    - Isolate Elements, Isolate Skills. Decompose Elements into subelements then instruct them in isolation.

- 🔷<beta>Lesson</beta>: Follow the instructor. Follow the instructor while they plant. Instructor can make error on purpose to test student's 💜<psike>ErrorDetection</psike> ability. You integrate information more deeply when teaching it, students become teachers in this lesson.

- 🔷<beta>Instruction</beta>: Let Plantor get in the groove before observing
    - CurrentSite, AnteSite, PostSite are NOT NULL is more realistic than one tree at a time.

- 🔷<beta>Instruction</beta>: CurseOfKnowledge. Instructors can take for granted their knowledge. When using jargon for the first few times, remember to explain to student what it means.

- 🔷<beta>Instruction</beta>: Only ask for an answer to a question that students could plausibly know. Apriori will only cause frustration and can easily become condescending.

- 🔷<beta>Instruction</beta>: So there isn't resistance, set the intentions of student by asking questions like "Do you want to plant as fast as possible?", "Why are we doing this lesson?", " Why did you come planting?"
