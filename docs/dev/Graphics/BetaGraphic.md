## BetaDiagram is a subset of BetaGraphic

How is Risk visualized?
Percentage?

Metromap

Treeview of Complexity

EinsteinSpaghetti Timeline of instances

Network of interacting elements. Network can extend to the opposite side of the piece if looking at a landmark, don't limit the instance by space, only by time

Line width is BetaIntensity

Nested along a via line

Each Subsystem is an ImageLayer. How are shown all at once?

Interactive Diagram can happen in a static website. How to make them work for every screen size?

How to layer network of influence over cartographic? Beta over land

Don't show all beta, chunk, scoped, highlights, error, injury, event ends

Repetitions of planting instance

Planting moment is the spacetime unit
At this moment what elements are being used and with what state?

State is all the values. An element is a Kanon, template, holding structure, framework. PokÃ©mon card Kanon

Are there any history of pokemon cards or playing cards

Use Pokemon as an analogy for system and element. Each character is a variation on a Pokemon Kanon.

State is Nondual.

## Betaglot Docs

For a beginner, how do Vue and Python docs suck?

No images of humans at a computer. It doesn't even need to be technical, just an image to show explicitly that people use this system, it's not just some abstract thing
