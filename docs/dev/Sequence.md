## Concurrency

> In computer science, concurrency is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the outcome. 

Asyncronous

## Parallelism

> Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time.

## Differentiate(Algorithm, Phrase)

All algorithms are Phrases. "Phrase" is more commonplace than "Algorithm". Use "Phrase" instead of Algorithm to increase accessiblity to atheletes and other people who are averse to math. The purpose of Plantbeta is not to convince people of the utility of mathematical **theory**, rather, it's to use math in **practice**.
