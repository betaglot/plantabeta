# ðŸ›  Sequence

All sequences are lists 

```py
PythonDataType = List[]
```

```md
1. Thing1
2. Thing2
3. Thing3
4. Thing4

```

Standardize the way that sequences of BetaElements are represented in code and graphically.

## Differentiate(Sequence, Supermove, Move, Submove, BodyMove)

An ArmSequence is a list of ArmMoves performed in Parallel (BoxCarry), Concurrently (SpadeLift, TreeLoad)



## Control Flow Statements

Control flow is the codified version of [Decision Making](/reference/Neuro/Decision/Overview)

- Decision
    - Conscious
- Reaction
    - Automatic

### ðŸ’œ Flow Chart

- Highlight current Sequence branch, synchronize with 

### If

- Conditional

## Concurrency

> In computer science, concurrency is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the outcome. 

## Parallelism

> Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time.

## Differentiate(Algorithm, Sequence)

All algorithms are sequences. "Sequence" is more commonplace than "Algorithm". Use "Sequence" instead of Algorithm to increase accessiblity to atheletes and other people who are averse to math. The purpose of Plantbeta is not to convince people of the utility of mathematical **theory**, rather, it's to use math in **practice**.
