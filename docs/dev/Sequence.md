## Sequences are represented as

### Cards

### [Python List](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range)
>
> Lists are mutable sequences, typically used to store collections of homogeneous items (where the precise degree of similarity will vary by application).

### [Python Range](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#ranges)
>
> The range type represents an immutable sequence of numbers and is commonly used for looping a specific number of times in for loops.

### [Python Tuple](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#tuples)
>
> Tuples are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data (such as the 2-tuples produced by the enumerate() built-in). Tuples are also used for cases where an immutable sequence of homogeneous data is needed (such as allowing storage in a set or dict instance).

```py
>>> list(range(10))
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
>>> list(range(1, 11))
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
>>> list(range(0, 30, 5))
[0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
>>> list(range(0, 10, 3))
[0, 3, 6, 9]
>>> list(range(0, -10, -1))
[0, -1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9]
>>> list(range(0))
[]
>>> list(range(1, 0))
[]
```

## Concurrency

> In computer science, concurrency is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the outcome.

Asyncronous

## Parallelism

> Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or processes are carried out simultaneously. Large problems can often be divided into smaller ones, which can then be solved at the same time.

## Differentiate(Algorithm, Phrase)

All algorithms are Phrases. "Phrase" is more commonplace than "Algorithm". Use "Phrase" instead of Algorithm to increase accessiblity to atheletes and other people who are averse to math. The purpose of Put(Plant) is not to convince people of the utility of mathematical **theory**, rather, it's to use math in **practice**.
