Pannier

- To keep sidebags open
- To keep sidebags from rubbing on legs.
- Suspension system

### <move>BackBag Flap</move>

- Use waterproof Flap instead of sphincter design, since sphincter allows water to collect and slowly seep into backbag.
- Pocket on underside of Flap

"han kote" is a Japanese Vambrace

Vambrace with a Glove under

The goal of vambrace is to keep the hand clean and warm. There isn't a need to protect the forearm like military vambraces

### Design Constraint

- The prinicipal constraint is being able to fit your hand, proximal of the knuckles, into the OpenHole without getting snagged on the hole.

### Lightyear Notepad

### Warmth
- Vambrace triplet brochure conductive metal sheets to wear on core then transfer to forearms
    - Extra weight for more heat during cold weather
- Gaunlet which extends up forarm for protection and warmth.
- You only need to worry about the back of your hands. Glabrous warms the palm
- Wool lining

### <move>Flagger</move>

Ideally there would be a Flagger on each Vambrace

## <move>Glove</move>

- SplitMitt Shell
    - Easier to repair 
    - Keep fingers warmers by pairing them
    - Less Seams
    - More simple shape than gloves which allows thicker material to be used on dorsal to protect
    - Easier to take off because there is more material to pinch and also less surface area for friction. The surfaces between fingers is removed. The ConvexHull of a PeaceSign. 

- Purlicue padding for SpadeSlide Grip

- Do gloves need to be tight?

- Glove which can have fingers repaired. At least the Middle Three fingers.
- Glove which does not collect dirt unlike the knitted gloves currently used by most planters
- Easily taken off without getting dirt inside

Spacesuit

- Swap out hips to dry the sweat to prevent SkinErosion. Wet skin erodes more than dry skin.
- Adding a warm layer without having to take off your entire top layer
- Vambraces are constant

### Systematic

Everything fits together and is modular.

### Modularity

#### Suit of Armor
- Samurai Armor
