## Planter Bags

`Analogy{Saddle: PlanterBag}`

### Bag Material

### Bag Skeleton

Pannier

- To keep sidebags open
- To keep sidebags from rubbing on legs.
- Suspension system

### BackBag Flap

- Use waterproof Flap instead of sphincter design, since sphincter allows water to collect and slowly seep into backbag.
- Pocket on underside of Flap


## Flag

- Paper
- Conformable
- Biodegradable
- BlueInk

## Vambrace

"han kote" is a Japanese Vambrace

Vambrace with a Glove under

The goal of vambrace is to keep the hand clean and warm. There isn't a need to protect the forearm like military vambraces

### Design Constraint

- The prinicipal constraint is being able to fit your hand, proximal of the knuckles, into the OpenHole without getting snagged on the hole.

### Warmth
- Vambrace triplet brochure conductive metal sheets to wear on core then transfer to forearms
    - Extra weight for more heat during cold weather
- Gaunlet which extends up forarm for protection and warmth.
- You only need to worry about the back of your hands. Glabrous warms the palm
- Wool lining

### Flagger

Ideally there would be a Flagger on each Vambrace

## Glove

- SplitMitt Shell
    - Easier to repair 
    - Keep fingers warmers by pairing them
    - Less Seams
    - More simple shape than gloves which allows thicker material to be used on dorsal to protect
    - Easier to take off because there is more material to pinch and also less surface area for friction. The surfaces between fingers is removed. The ConvexHull of a PeaceSign. 

- Purlicue padding for SpadeSlide Grip

- Do gloves need to be tight?

- Glove which can have fingers repaired. At least the Middle Three fingers.
- Glove which does not collect dirt unlike the knitted gloves currently used by most planters
- Easily taken off without getting dirt inside
