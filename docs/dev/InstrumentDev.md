#### Kirigami

> Kirigami is a variation of origami, the Japanese art of folding paper. In kirigami, the paper is cut as well as being folded, resulting in a three-dimensional design that stands away from the page.

- Suspension system

### ⭐<labor>BackBagDev</labor>

- ❌<error>There needs to be another moniker for "BackBag"</error>
    - Something like "Instrumentbox"

- Use waterproof Flap instead of sphincter design, since sphincter allows water to collect and slowly seep into backbag.
- Pocket on underside of Flap

- Water, Food, Gloves, ShellLayer, WarmLayer,

Long thin bag is easier to sit with

Theres air space between Planter and the seat in front of them

V shape center contact between feet

Cover water with insulation layer at cache

What could go at base

- Fremkit from Dune
- Water container in base so that it doesn't crush or leak onto contents and so weight is close to hips
- BagCover which can be worn as a Cape when it's really rainy or wet
    - Wear the bag

- Attach through gromets along border

- Store the Insulation Layer

### ⭐<labor>RadiorDev</labor>

#### Etymology(Radior)

"Radius" + "or" :: Agent of Forearm

- <https://eu.directactiongear.com/en/grg-pouchr.html#RGR>

"han kote" is a Japanese Vambrace

Vambrace with a Glove under

The goal of vambrace is to keep the hand clean and warm. There isn't a need to protect the forearm like military vambraces

#### Design Constraint

- The prinicipal constraint is being able to fit your hand, proximal of the knuckles, into the OpenHole without getting snagged on the hole.

#### Lightyear Notepad

- Vambrace triplet brochure conductive metal sheets to wear on core then transfer to forearms
    - Extra weight for more heat during cold weather
- Gaunlet which extends up forarm for protection and warmth.
- You only need to worry about the back of your hands. Glabrous warms the palm
- Wool lining

### ⭐<labor>PaddingDev</labor>

- HipPadding
- KneePadding
- ShoulderPadding
- Hockey Padding which doesn't have a shell

- Corset
    - Planters wear a corset under their waist belt like a saddle pad
    - Corset restricts BendOver

### ⭐<labor>PantDev</labor>

- Gusset to strengthen crotch

The Blanket which goes on a horse, before and under the saddle.

### Design Constraint

Holes in fabric snag, which often leads to the hole becoming larger and can potentially prevent MOTON.

RipStop Fabric

Warp or Weft, which is stronger?

- Extra padding to strengthen attachment point and to prevent erosion from metal wire from rubbing on boot leather.
- Big zipper

### ⭐<labor>GloveDev</labor>

- GloveShell
    - HardSurface on palm like Starwars StormTrooper, marvel

- Gloveon() ThumbTab
- SplitMitt Shell
    - Easier to repair
    - Keep fingers warmers by pairing them
    - Less Seams
    - More simple shape than gloves which allows thicker material to be used on dorsal to protect
    - Easier to take off because there is more material to pinch and also less surface area for friction. The surfaces between fingers is removed. The ConvexHull of a PeaceSign.

- Purlicue: the distance between one's forefinger and thumb when extended
    - Purlicue padding for SpadeSlide Mano

- Do gloves need to be tight?

- Glove which can have fingers repaired. At least the Middle Three fingers.
