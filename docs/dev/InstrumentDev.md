### ‚≠ê<labor>BagSkeletonDev</labor>

Pannier

- To keep sidebags ope
- To keep sidebags from rubbing on legs.
- Suspension system

### ‚≠ê<labor>BackBagDev</labor>

- ‚ùå<error>There needs to be another moniker for "BackBag"</error>
    - Something like "Instrumentbox"

- Use waterproof Flap instead of sphincter design, since sphincter allows water to collect and slowly seep into backbag.
- Pocket on underside of Flap

### ‚≠ê<labor>MarkaforDev</labor>

- DiskShooter which shoots DiskFlag which expands and has hooks
- Each time you pull a flag out, it triggers a geolocation
    - How long does it take to send the signal? You can't stop moving to wait for the transmission.

Ideally there would be a Markor on each Radior

- Stored in many places like a knife thrower in Assassins Creed doesn't throw from the same place each time. Take from wherever is most convenient.

- Water, Food, Gloves, ShellLayer, WarmLayer,

Long thin bag is easier to sit with

Theres air space between plantor and the seat in front of them

V shape center contact between feet

Cover water with insulation layer at cache

What could go at base

- Fremkit from Dune
- Water container in base so that it doesn't crush or leak onto contents and so weight is close to hips
- BagCover which can be worn as a Cape when it's really rainy or wet
    - Wear the bag

### ‚≠ê<labor>RadiorDev</labor>

#### Etymology(Radior)

"Radius" + "or" :: Agent of Forearm

- <https://eu.directactiongear.com/en/grg-pouchr.html#RGR>

"han kote" is a Japanese Vambrace

Vambrace with a Glove under

The goal of vambrace is to keep the hand clean and warm. There isn't a need to protect the forearm like military vambraces

#### Design Constraint

- The prinicipal constraint is being able to fit your hand, proximal of the knuckles, into the OpenHole without getting snagged on the hole.

#### Lightyear Notepad

- Vambrace triplet brochure conductive metal sheets to wear on core then transfer to forearms
    - Extra weight for more heat during cold weather
- Gaunlet which extends up forarm for protection and warmth.
- You only need to worry about the back of your hands. Glabrous warms the palm
- Wool lining

### ‚≠ê<labor>PaddingDev</labor>

- HipPadding
- KneePadding
- ShoulderPadding
- Hockey Padding which doesn't have a shell

- Corset
    - Plantors wear a corset under their waist belt like a saddle pad
    - Corset restricts BendOver

### ‚≠ê<labor>PantDev</labor>

- Gusset to strengthen crotch

The Blanket which goes on a horse, before and under the saddle.

### Design Constraint

Holes in fabric snag, which often leads to the hole becoming larger and can potentially prevent MOTON.

RipStop Fabric

Warp or Weft, which is stronger?

- SplitMitt Shell
    - Easier to repair
    - Keep fingers warmers by pairing them
    - Less Seams
    - More simple shape than gloves which allows thicker material to be used on dorsal to protect
