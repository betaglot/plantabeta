### Kirigami

> Kirigami is a variation of origami, the Japanese art of folding paper. In kirigami, the paper is cut as well as being folded, resulting in a three-dimensional design that stands away from the page.

### 🟠<motor>BackBagDev</motor>

- ❌<error>There needs to be another moniker for "BackBag"</error>
    - Something like "Instrumentbox"

- Use waterproof Flap instead of sphincter design, since sphincter allows water to collect and slowly seep into backbag.
- Pocket on underside of Flap

### 🟠<motor>MarkaforDev</motor>

Ideally there would be a Markor on each Ulnor

- <https://eu.directactiongear.com/en/grg-pouchr.html#RGR>

"han kote" is a Japanese Vambrace

Vambrace with a Glove under

The goal of vambrace is to keep the hand clean and warm. There isn't a need to protect the forearm like military vambraces

#### Design Constraint

- The prinicipal constraint is being able to fit your hand, proximal of the knuckles, into the OpenHole without getting snagged on the hole.

#### Lightyear Notepad

- Vambrace triplet brochure conductive metal sheets to wear on core then transfer to forearms
    - Extra weight for more heat during cold weather
- Gaunlet which extends up forarm for protection and warmth.
- You only need to worry about the back of your hands. Glabrous warms the palm
- Wool lining

### 🟠<motor>PaddingDev</motor>

- HipPadding
- KneePadding
- ShoulderPadding
- Hockey Padding which doesn't have a shell

- Corset
    - Plantors wear a corset under their waist belt like a saddle pad
    - Corset restricts BendOver

### 🟠<motor>PantDev</motor>

- Gusset to strengthen crotch

The Blanket which goes on a horse, before and under the saddle.

### Design Constraint

Holes in fabric snag, which often leads to the hole becoming larger and can potentially prevent MOTON.

RipStop Fabric

Warp or Weft, which is stronger?
