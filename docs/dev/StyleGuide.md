## Polysemy

::: warning 

It's easy to get stuck on the linguistics and naming. You can think about it for hours while in the land. While sitting in front of a computer your time is better spent typing, not thinking about increasing the clarity. Just get it out, then you can edit. 

:::

### "Planting"

Planting= Planting Industry
Planting= Putting a Tree in the Ground

### "Plant"

Try to avoid PlantPlant plant a plant in the ground. InsertPlant

InsertPod


Plant= Put a Tree in the Ground
- Put

Plant= Organism from Plantae

## LevelOfDetail

No Acronyms

Write complete sentences.

Point form is lazy. Think about all the coding documentation which is not easy to read. Too formal, too concise, humans don't process language like computers, point of view matters.

## "a" not "the"

> The definite article "the" is used before a noun to indicate that the identity of the noun is known to the reader. The indefinite article "a, an" is used before a noun that is general or when its identity is not known.

Good
> Obstacle within a Hole

Bad
> Obstacle within the Hole

## Emoji

### Purpose(Emoji)

- Visual Search
- For planters to use the emojis 
- Each emoji can be easily handwritten, since electronics don't do well in extreme weather, in terms of breaking and in UX. You can't easily view a screen in summer sun, or rain, definitely not in snow.

The BetaModules are aliased as emojis.
