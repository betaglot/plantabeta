# Pedagogy

Learn by recall instead of trial and error

Rookie Stare isn't experienced as Vision

Do you remember everything

Does all the knowledge that you finished your last season with remain when you start your next season?

How would you even know?

Wouldn't it be nice to know what you've forgotten. If you could take a test to find out, would you take it?

## Tutorials

## VideoGame

PurposeGames.com

Use Instruments that GenZ is already addicted to. Many PotentialPlantors are young adults who are addicted to playing video games. Create a video game which teaches PlantaBeta so plantors can increase their planting knowledge before the season starts.

It's ok if the game is boring if you're being paid to play it.

## CurseOfKnowledge

The best way to reduce the CurseOfKnowledge is to check the user's knowledge frequently. Asking if the user has questions is not enough, because the user may not even have enough knowledge to ask a question.

- Does that make sense?
- Do you understand?
- Paraphrase what I just said.
    - Users really know something when it becomes encoded in Mentalese. Only Mentalese can produce a paraphrase.

### UI ToReduceCurseOfKnowledge

- Instrumenttips like Wikipedia On(Hover)

## Skreefing Lesson

Use the sand at 10cm below surface for SpadeSkreef, since it's a similar density to the soil on the block, unlike the loose dry surface sand.

## Pacer

Use an ExperiencedPlantor to act as a Pacer for NovicePlantors. To show the speed goal speed. Be sure that the Pacer isn't competing with the Novices, that is, the Pacer must not try to constantly go faster than the novices.

## How would instructor fit into deadlines?

## Cohort

Teaching TeamBeta is more practical than individuals

## Teaching Block, Teaching Piece

Set up a piece

InstructionalPiece

Marka the stations

## Send in your work to be Evaluated

Submit image of drawing for testing

- Draw a BetaDiagram

## Video Analysis

To understand what's going on in the plantor video

### VideoLabelling

Fundamental BetaUnit of Plantbeta is between HoleCloses... after the StartHole which is preceded by CacheMove

Parse into events

Each PutLoop

- loop ends with Hole Close

#### Tree_ID

Edit tree count into video

Each tree has a unique identifer use a 8digit number

Link tree id to gpx

## Daily Questions

To stay engaged in learning

Question to ask themselves to not get bored without audio

## 'Mentor' is too strong a word

Have an Experienced Plantor plant with novicePlantor as a practical demonstration and for confidence in quality

## Setting

### AtCamp

### InTransit

### OnTheBlock
