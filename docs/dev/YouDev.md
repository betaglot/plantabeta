‚ÄúAE Drive is our rugby output software that actually generates the graphics. We have our AE Catch data handling system ‚Äì you can see where we‚Äôre going here with Catch and Drive ‚Äì where the data comes in and we ‚Äòcatch‚Äô it. Then there‚Äôs AE Tick, which controls the clocks which have now become an enormous part of the game.

‚ÄúAE Snap, our CIS [Commentator Information System], is the tool that does an awful lot of work in pulling together the timing, scoring, Stats Perform and the Sportable Smart Ball data into one usable screen that is shared around the OB and is visible to everyone in production, commentary and graphics,‚Äù said Smith.
