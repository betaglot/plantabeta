## Teknik Magnitude = SkhemaEdgeCount

Teknik magnitude is seen by the number of edges in a graph, not necessarily nodeCount

The HeaderImage of Teknik overview is a Graph

See Wolfram Euclid for graphs of dependencies. All dependencies are represented by at least

## Fewer Teknik not less

Teknik is a quantity, not a quality.

Proportional to the number of Elements of any BetaType.

For example:

ðŸ”·Walking across a Slackline is high Teknik because it require many concurrent ðŸŸ movements at many different joints, while the ðŸŸ©slackline moves, you must know ðŸ”»where to place your foot without looking, and during all of this you can't let your ðŸ’œmind wander.

ðŸŸ Reach is LowTeknik because it only uses one MOTON
