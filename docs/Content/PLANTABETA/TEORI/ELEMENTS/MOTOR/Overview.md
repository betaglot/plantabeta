# ðŸ”·ðŸŸ  Motor Teori

A RICscore description for a single MOTON.

- SuperMOTON, SubMOTON

- MOTONRICscore is used to compare MOTONs. AlternativeMOTONs can be compared to find a MOTON which fits in a MOTONSequence.
    - MOTONComparison

- MOTONPattern.Theoria
    - A Theoria description for a single MOTONPattern, which is composed of many MOTONs.
    - Used to compare multiple MOTONPatterns.

## Unlike Via, Motor Pages are composed of Definitions and Propositions

This is a Jump (Teorem), this is how to Jump (Problem), this is you jumping (Praktik)

This is a BoustroLine (Teorem), this how to construction a BoutroLine (Problem), this is land planted with a BoustroLine (Praktik)

Propositions never have errors. Errors only occur in Praktik

There is less Via than MOTONs. It makes more sense to group MOTONElements by their definitions (their concrete objects)

Each BetaTipos is like a Book

EkosBook
ViaBook
MotorBook
AnimaBook

then later Books combine them into Beta

BetaBook1
    - Deadwalking is a waste of time
BetaBook2
    - How to plant faster
