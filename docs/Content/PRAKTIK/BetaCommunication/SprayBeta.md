Do Not SprayBeta.

## Definition of SprayBeta

- Spoiling the puzzle of Beta.

- Unsolicited GiveBeta.

- GiveBeta without AskBeta.

- Beta is "sprayed" when Beta is given without being asked for it.

- Can be a form of "mansplaining"

## Why not SprayBeta?

SprayBeta is like spoiling the plot of a movie or solving someone's puzzle. Part of the fun of Climbing is problem solving, so when someone sprays Beta they are reducing the potential fun that a Climber can have while trying a Route.

Sometimes the sprayed Beta isn't even useful.

## Spray Range

Beta can be sprayed from one Climber to another in a normal speaking volume or Beta can be sprayed over a larger range when it is yelled at a Climber who is on the wall.

## Can you SprayBeta by Miming?

::: danger

Even when you're not Climbing, you can still get sprayed with Beta!

- There's a way to talk about Beta without spraying it. What are the errors and how to avoid or catch them. Exiting a conversation is the very last ElseStatement
- Overwhelming with Beta isn't the same as BetaSpray so it can be precise not a dispersed Spray
