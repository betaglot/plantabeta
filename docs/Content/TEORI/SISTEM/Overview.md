# 🕸 Sistem

Sistem is in the Guide

> Sistem's structure is repeated in each SistemType. The "Sistem" section doesn't contain the content, it shows how everything is related to each other.

Each SistemType is structured into Praktik and Teoria

Combinatorial system

DeclarativeLanguage

BETAGLOTS are people who apply the SISTEM to multiple sports

::: tip The language is not the organization (except for Klimbeta)
Gymnastics : CodeOfPoints :: BETAGLOT : SISTEM :: PlantaBeta : PlantaBeta :: Klimbeta : Klimbeta
:::

BETAGLOT is the organization which is developing SISTEM.py and applying it to solo sports

SISTEM is the system which is composed of EKO, MOVE, VIA, Anima

The term Beta can refer to any of the BetaTypes. All TypeElements inherit from BetaElement, which is the Base class. EkoElement

The terms "Element" is used instead of "Object", since abstract objects are difficult to understand and will render SISTEM inaccessible to everyone who isn't a computer scientist or philosopher.

### Deductive Axiomatic System

Mountain pose is the first element in the system

Same for climbing

Yoga is more ancestral than Climbing

## Differentiate(Teoria, Praktik)

> theory refers to the construction of theories and the explicit knowledge derived from them, while practice involves the understanding and implementation of practical knowledge in real-world situations

"Theory" is consistently misunderstood and misused. How to point this out without judgement? In the Ivory Tower is the last place that BETAGLOTs need to be.  

Knowing how to solve a problem isn't the same as actually solving the problem. Knowing how to draw an equilateral triangle doesn't result in an actual triangle on paper. You must put the knowledge into practice.

You can't have Practice in the encyclopedia. Practice only exists in the Akademeia Section.

> When we try to think our way out of bad situations to avoid getting hurt, we become engaged in trying to think of a solution instead of acting on one

> Use your Knowledge to act

It seems like there is a bias towards action instead of theory, like theory is somehow useless.

> That all sounds good in theory

The Theory of Gravitation is not useless, The Theory of Natural Selection is not useless. Architecture doesn't exist without  

## Teoria Propositions are declared in Praktik BETOMIKS

Call a Proposition

Propose a Proposition

## ArmSwing is a Proposition

ArmSwing is a Proposition

Arm is a Definition

Swing is a Proposition

## BetaMoment

> all the BetaElements occuring at a given instant

Anton gormley BoxBodies are like BetaInstanceCube

BetaMoment is a Tuple or at least an immutable DataStructure

::: details 🛠 <dev>&&&</dev>

- There's gonna be recursion
- Beta does not require Sistem, PlantaBeta\Beta requires a Sistem
- Do Definitions have methods?
- Arm has the method to flex or extend
- Remove the Concept of Elements
- Propositions are Objects
- Propositions have attributes and Methods
- All Mooves have the method to connect to another Moove in a sequence
- The sistema is for knowing what beta to use
    - Given this situation what methods do I use with what objects and how to tune their attributes to increase ease of performance
