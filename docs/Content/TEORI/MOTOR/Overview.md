# ðŸ”·ðŸŸ  Motor Teori

A RICscore description for a single Moove.

- SuperMoove, SubMoove

- MooveRICscore is used to compare Mooves. AlternativeMooves can be compared to find a Moove which fits in a MooveSequence.
    - MooveComparison

- MoovePattern.Theoria
    - A Theoria description for a single MoovePattern, which is composed of many Mooves.
    - Used to compare multiple MoovePatterns.

## Unlike Via, Motor Pages are composed of Definitions and Propositions

This is a Jump (Teorem), this is how to Jump (Problem), this is you jumping (Praktik)

This is a BoustroLine (Teorem), this how to construction a BoutroLine (Problem), this is land planted with a BoustroLine (Praktik)

Propositions never have errors. Errors only occur in Praktik

There is less Via than Mooves. It makes more sense to group MooveElements by their definitions (their concrete objects)

Each BetaTipos is like a Book

EkosBook
ViaBook
MotorBook
AnimaBook

then later Books combine them into Beta

BetaBook1
    - Deadwalking is a waste of time
BetaBook2
    - How to plant faster
