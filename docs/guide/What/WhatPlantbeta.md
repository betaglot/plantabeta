![BetaSetDiagram](/BetaSetDiagram.png)

Plantbeta.com is a **product** specifically designed to train Planters how to plant more efficiently. 

- Plantbeta is a web app which contains all the information that a Planter needs to know to perform their job in the [Reference](/reference/ReferenceOverview) section. 
- Plantbeta has a [Tests](/tests/TestsOverview) section for Planters to reinforce their knowledge and to find any gaps in their knowledge.
- Unlike [Replant.ca](/https://replant.ca/), Plantbeta contains no information about the business side of planting, it's only from the Planter's perspective. 
- Each element of Plantbeta has its own profile. Currently you will see placeholders for each section of the profile. Each element profile has a profile picture, element description, a relationship graph showing how it relates to elements from the other subsystems, descriptions of how elements from other subsystems relate to the current element and at the bottom of the profile there are links to related elements (like the "See Also" section in Wikipedia pages). Not only are Planters shown all the elements, but more importantly they are shown how they relate to each other. Some elements are highly related to other element such as [Attention](/reference/Neuro/Attention) (NeuroElement), while others are not related to other subsystems such as [TreeLoad](/reference/Move/ArmMove/TreeLoad) (grabbing a tree from your bag).
    - [PocketArea](/reference/Environment/Area/PocketArea)
        - It's more efficient to AreaFill than PerimeterFill (RouteElements) a PocketArea.
        - You need to define the boundaries of the area (NeuroElement).
    - [HandScreef](/reference/Move/HandMove/HandScreef)
        - The SoilType (EnvironmentElement) determines if you SpadeScreef or HandScreef.
        - You need to see and feel (NeuroElements) where the duff layer becomes MineralSoil to perform an effective HandScreef.
    - [BackFill](/reference/Route/PieceFill/BackFill)
        - The shape of the Piece (EnvironmentElement) determines if you want to BackFill or AreaFill.
    - [BagUpSizeDecision](/reference/Neuro/Decision/BagUpSizeDecision)
        - The Environment affects the BagUpSize, bigger BagUpSize for straight trenches (EnvironmentElement) compared to RawEnvironment (EnvironmentElement).
        - BagUpSize depends on how fatigued (Neuro) you are.
        - BagUpSize affects how fast you can move (MoveElement) and how easily you can climb over slash (EnvironmentElement).
        - If you need to BackFill (RouteElement) a piece then you typically have a large BagUpSize.

Plantbeta will provide a Planter training **service** to planting companies before and during the planting season. 

::: tip You're going think...
- That Plantbeta can't deliver on its promises.
- Youâ€™re going to think that this is more complicated than it needs to be.
- Youâ€™re going to think that this is too much for a Rookie to take in.
- You're going to think that a web app can't make people better Planters.

---
 
### Provides Access and Informs

- What is tree planting really like?
- Plan what to bring ahead of first planting season
- Access to information about being a Planter.
- Provides access to information about how to plant which currently only exists in the brains of ExperiencedPlanters.

---
 
### Saves Time and Cost 

- Plantbeta is designed to increase a Planter's planting rate, which will decrease the number of days it takes to complete a planting season. Shorter seasons means less money spent on feeding, transporting and housing Planters.

---

    - [BetaComp](https://klimbeta.github.io/BetaComp/)
- Connects RookiePlanters to ExperiencedPlanters

---
 
### Reduces Effort

- Plantbeta informs Planters on the 
- Increased CognitiveEase leads to feelings of effortlessness.
- Fluid movement through the Environment.
- Reduces the distance travelled by Planters by using efficient Routing.

---
 
### Avoids hassles

- Avoids the hassle of training rookies for PlanterSupervisors, when they have so many other tasks to perform during a planting day.  

---
 
### Increases Quality

- Increases the quality of the planted seedlings.
- Increases the ability of Planters.

## How is Plantbeta Innovative and Educational?

> Work smarter not harder

- Plantbeta is **FREE** educational resource for Planters.

### Plantbeta utilizes Climbing  

Plantbeta borrows the concept of Beta to explain how to plant in greater nuance than ever before, by breaking down a Planter's experience into 4 interdependent subsystems, Planters can pinpoint the aspects of their experience which can be improved, while also having a greater vocabulary to explain what they're doing to other Planter who [share the same Piece of Land](/reference/Route/TeamPlant/Overview).

![BetaSetDiagram](/BetaSetDiagram.png)

By connecting Climbing and Planting through their mutual use of a Beta System, Planters can improve their planting ability **before and after their planting season** by practicing indoor climbing.
