# What is Tree Planting?

![InstaPhoto033](/InstaPhoto033.jpg)

Every year millions of tree seedlings are planted across Canada. As shown in the image above, the Planter finds a suitable place to plant a seedling, then uses a spade to open holes for the seedling to be inserted, then the Planter closes the hole and the cycle repeats thousands of times each day.  

Every step of the planting process can be optimized, usually it takes Planters a whole season (approximately 80 days) to learn how to plant trees efficiently.
