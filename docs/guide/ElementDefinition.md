Route

- You will notice that all ElementNames have no spaces between their words, this is to make it easier to search for terms with Plantbeta's search and when looking with your eyes.

Each of the Beta Subsystems ([Land](), [Movement](), [Route](), [Neuro]() ) has its own elements, although most elements are a combination of all four subsystems. For example [HandClose]() depends on the [SoilType]() (Land), [Touch and Pressure sensations]() (Neuro), and the obstacles which narrow the range of [approach trajectories]() possible to perform the [HandClose]() (Route).

Elements are added together to create new, more complex, elements. For example [ShovelScreef]() = {[HandleGrip](), [ShaftGrip](), [Soil](), [SlopeAngle](), [Slash](), [Attention]()}

### Purpose

- Simplification
- Chunking
- Parsing

### Actions

- Break down into Simples

> Break down the movement.

> Break down into its component parts.
