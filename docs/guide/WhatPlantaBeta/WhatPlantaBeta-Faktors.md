<LabonCardCarousel/>

⭐<span class="labor">LABOR</span> is the <span class="labor">goal</span> or <span class="labor">purpose</span> of an experience.

In climbing <span class="labor">LABOR</span> is experienced as the <span class="labor">competition</span>, the <span class="labor">route</span>, the other <span class="labor">competitors</span>, the <span class="labor">time limit</span>, the <span class="labor">tools</span> you use, the <span class="labor">clothes</span> you wear and any other <span class="labor">rules</span> or <span class="labor">regulations</span>.

In some sports like Ski Racing or Kayaking, the goal is to complete your <span class="labor">route</span> (course) as quickly as possible, just like Speed Climbing.

In other sports <span class="labor">athletes</span> must <span class="labor">perform</span> specific <span class="labor">Aktions</span>. These <span class="labor">Aktions</span> are known by various names among the different sports.

In <span class="labor">Freestyle Skiing</span>, <span class="labor">Diving</span> and <span class="labor">Skateboarding</span> you would call an <span class="labor">Aktion</span> a "trick" or "maneuver", while in <span class="labor">Gymnastics</span> you'd say "element". As you will see "element" means something slightly different in <span class="beta">BETAGLOT</span>

The similarity between all <span class="labor">Aktions</span> is that they are <span class="labor">performed</span> and <span class="labor">judged</span> based on the <span class="labor">Execution</span>, <span class="labor">Difficulty</span>.

::: details What's with the weird way that <span class="labor">Aktion</span> is spelled?

You will notice that some of the spellings that <span class="beta">BETAGLOT</span> uses are not English, this is because whenever possible I have tried to use names which are composed of a hybrid between Latin and Greek. This naming convention is designed to fit together with the languages of Biology, Physics, Geology, Philosophy and Psychology, which are all based in Latin or Greek.

- _Homo Sapien, Sodium Chloride, Glacier, Psychoanalysis, Bacteria, Biceps Brachii, Flexion, Pandemic, Echo_

The purpose of changing the spelling is to enable people from various languages to be able use the names without translation, to make it easier to share and communicate globally. To ensure that the names are easy to pronounce <span class="beta">BETAGLOT</span> uses the letter "K" instead of "C" when relevant and also removes silent letters, like "H".

---

- Action ---> <span class="labor">Aktion</span>
- Eco ---> <span class="ekos">Ekos</span>

---

If you speak English, French, Spanish or Portuguese, then it should be possible for you to pronounce every name in <span class="beta">BETAGLOT</span>

:::

A simple example of an <span class="labor">Aktion</span> is reaching. When you reach for something there is an intrinsic goal, to actually get to and establish a grip on a hold.

A more complex element of <span class="labor">LABOR</span> is a <span class="labor">route</span>. The <span class="labor">goal</span> of a <span class="labor">route</span> is to get to the top of it, or at least get to the <span class="labor">Zone Hold</span> in <span class="labor">bouldering</span>.

::: details Here are some more <span class="labor">Aktions</span>

- Going through a <span class="labor">Gate</span> in Slalom Skiing, and Kayaking
- <span class="labor">Reaching</span> with your foot or hand or hip
- Performing a <span class="labor">backflip</span>
- Performing a <span class="labor">dyno</span>
- <span class="labor">Heel Hook, Toe Hook</span>
- <span class="labor">Falling</span>
- <span class="labor">Rolling</span> your kayak
- <span class="labor">Jumping</span> off a ski jump
- <span class="labor">Grinding</span> on a rail
- Performing an <span class="labor">Ollie</span>
- Performing a <span class="labor">Handstand</span>
- <span class="labor">Gripping</span> a Sloper
- <span class="labor">Crimping</span> an Edge
- <span class="labor">Mobility</span>

Every person has a different body. The group 🔷<span class="soma">SOMA</span> (which is just greek for "body") describes the body part used to perform the <span class="labor">Aktion</span> and the specific properties are the <span class="soma">body part</span> and <span class="soma">body</span> in general.

Everyone is unique, the length of your <span class="soma">arms</span>, <span class="soma">BMI</span>, <span class="soma">total body height</span>, <span class="soma">age</span>, <span class="soma">ape index</span> etc. all affect the way that an <span class="labor">athlete</span> <span class="labor">performs</span> an <span class="labor">Aktion</span>.

You can <span class="labor">perform</span> the same <span class="labor">Aktion</span> with a different <span class="soma">body part</span>. You can <span class="labor">Reach</span> with your <span class="soma">Arm</span> or <span class="labor">Reach</span> with your <span class="soma">Leg</span>

<FaktorEmblem imageSource='/Emblem/Anima-Emblem.png'/>

<AnimonCardCarousel/>

The most fundamental of all the categories is 💜<span class="anima">ANIMA</span> (which was named "<span class="anima">Psyche</span>" for about a year during earlier development, but it seemed too difficult for kids to pronounce and it's unfortunately common for people to have a negative association with words like "<span class="anima">Psych</span>ology", "<span class="anima">Psych</span>iatrists").

<span class="anima">ANIMA</span> can be translated as "<span class="anima">soul</span>". Unlike the other categories <span class="anima">ANIMA</span> is mostly not <span class="anima">visible</span> from a third person point of view. The foundation of <span class="anima">ANIMA</span> and all other categories is <span class="anima">Awareness</span>, also called <span class="anima">consciousness</span> . <span class="anima">Awareness</span> is where "you" are, it's where your thoughts and sensations occur. <span class="anima">ANIMA</span> is not <span class="via">logical</span>, it is <span class="anima">emotional</span>, <span class="anima">intuitive</span>, can be <span class="anima">instinctual</span> and is usually <span class="anima">non-verbal</span>. <span class="anima">ANIMA</span> is anything that occurs in your <span class="anima">nervous system</span>.

Although your eyes are part of your body, <span class="beta">BETAGLOT</span> categorizes them as <span class="anima">ANIMA</span>, given that your retina is literally part of your brain.

### <span class="anima">ANIMA</span>, also known as Consciousness

<iframe class="youtube rounded-xl" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ex0Fwipzk5k" title="Experts from 4 different fields define consciousness" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

::: details Elements of <span class="anima">ANIMA</span> include:

- Attention
- Touch, Sight, Hearing, Taste, Proprioception
- Emotions, Moods
- Understanding, Intuition, Recognition
- Sense of Balance
- Metacognition
- Any thought

:::

## How do the categories go together?

<span class="text-h2 text-center"><span class="beta">BETOMs</span></span>

You've probably noticed that elements just exist by themselves, everything is connected as a combinatory system. The unit of combination is called a <span class="beta">BETOM</span>. The rainbow icon has all the colors of <span class="beta">BETAGLOT</span>.

Betoms must include at least two elements and are surrounded by square brackets
<div class="d-flex justify-center">
<div class="d-flex align-center">
<span class="text-h5">[</span><span class="labor">LABOR</span>|<span class="soma">SOMA</span>|<span class="ekos">EKOS</span>|<span class="via">VIA</span>|<span class="motor">MOTOR</span>|<span class="anima">ANIMA</span><span class="text-h5">]</span>
</div>
</div>
or represented digitally as these boxes

The order in which the elements of each group is listed is always the same:
