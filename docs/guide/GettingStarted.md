# Getting Started

The reference section is divided into four subsystems

- [LandSystem](/reference/Land/Overview)
- [MovementSystem](/reference/Movement/Overview)
- [RouteSystem](/reference/Route/Overview)
- [NeuroSystem](/reference/Neuro/Overview)

- Browse the Reference to find Elements which are novel to you, then follow their links to gain a deeper understanding to how the Element relates to other Elements.

## Links

- All links are displayed in [green font](/guide/getting-started)

## ElementNames

- You'll notice that all ElementNames have no spaces, this is to allow greater ease when searching for terms and also to denote Elements of Plantbeta.
