# Novice Planter

> A Planter who has not completed their first planting season.

## What does every Novice do before they go planting?

Novice Planters ALWAYS Google "How to Plant trees?" before starting the season. Why? To educate themselves as much as possible before starting work, because they know that the more knowledge they have about planting the more money they will make.
