## How to be an AmbidextrousPlanter

Experienced Planters have mastered the basics of planting, but they usually don't swap the roles of their arms. Many experienced Planters spend years only using their dominant hand for [SpadeMoto](/reference/Moto/SpadeMoto/Overview), not only does this dispose Planters to injury, it also complicates when Planters must have a specific mixture of species that they're planting. Ambidextrous Planters can separate the species into either side of their planting bags

To reduce injury caused by repetitive strain.

 Like, something would start somewhere, and then, people would take that thing and then they would take it somewhere else. So, all these parts of an original restaurant, they would end up at a new restaurant, and that kind of thing. That would happen over and over again. And then all these parts of all these restaurants,they would sort of, you know, they would find each other. And then new people would take those parts and they would put them into their restaurant.And the whole thing, it would start to happen all over again.
