# Rookie Planter

## What does every rookie do before they go planting?

Rookie planters ALWAYS Google "How to Plant trees?" before starting the season. Why? To educate themselves as much as possible before starting work, because they know that the more knowledge they have about planting the more money they will make.

The best resource which can be found is Replant.ca, but this site could be better.

- The [Dictionary](http://www.replant.ca/dictionary.html) has no images.
- The book [Step By Step](https://jonathan-scooter-clark.blogspot.com/2018/03/step-by-step.html) only has a couple chapters about how to actually plant trees AND you need to pay for it. I've personally bought two editions of the book and neither are useful to the planters themselves, it seems like the book is more useful to people like yourselves who run planting companies.
- Their [videos](https://jonathan-scooter-clark.blogspot.com/2017/02/tree-planter-training-learning-how-to.html) are not very precise.
