# What is an Element?

Plantbeta breaks down a planter's experience into simple elements. Each element has its own particular properties which when varied affect 

A change in the properties 


Change Element properties affect how it relates to other elements and changes their properties too. 

Ripple out across the web of relationships. 

Elements are mixed together to create more complex elements or linked together into a new sequence of elements.

Euclid's Elements

The Euclid's Elements is compilation of elements which was written over x years ago. Until last century most people studied <u>The Elements</u> in school.

Planters mostly use Book 1 which is simple.

Route

- You will notice that all ElementNames have no spaces between their words, this is to make it easier to search for terms with Plantbeta's search and when looking with your eyes.

<img height="300" width="500" src="/PascalCase.png">

Each of the Beta Subsystems ([Land](), [Movement](), [Route](), [Neuro]() ) has its own elements, although most elements are a combination of all four subsystems. For example [HandClose]() depends on the [SoilType]() (Land), [Touch and Pressure sensations]() (Neuro), and the obstacles which narrow the range of [approach trajectories]() possible to perform the [HandClose]() (Route).

Elements are added together to create new, more complex, elements. For example [ShovelScreef]() = {[HandleGrip](), [ShaftGrip](), [Soil](), [SlopeAngle](), [Slash](), [Attention]()}
