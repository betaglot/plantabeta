# What is an Element?

> An element is one of the parts of something that makes it work, or a quality that makes someone or something effective.

Plantbeta breaks down a planter's experience into simple elements. Each element has its own particular properties which when varied affect 

Change Element properties affect how it relates to other elements and changes their properties too. These changes ripple out across Plantbeta's web of relationships.

Euclid's Elements

The Euclid's Elements is compilation of elements which was written over x years ago. Until last century most people studied <u>The Elements</u> in school.

Planters mostly use Book 1 which is simple.

Each of the Beta Subsystems ([Land](), [Movement](), [Route](), [Neuro]() ) has its own elements, although most elements are a combination of all four subsystems. For example [HandClose]() depends on the [SoilType]() (Land), [Touch and Pressure sensations]() (Neuro), and the obstacles which narrow the range of [approach trajectories]() possible to perform the [HandClose]() (Route).

Elements are added together to create new, more complex, elements. For example [ShovelScreef]() = {[HandleGrip](), [ShaftGrip](), [Soil](), [SlopeAngle](), [Slash](), [Attention]()} 


## Element Properties

## Element Composition

Elements are mixed together to create more complex elements or linked together into a new sequence of elements.

### Element Mixture Composition

- Adding Elements together 
    - Like creating a Chemical Compound
        - [InsertImage] Water H20
- Increase Complexity
- Element Hierarchy


### Element Sequence Composition

A sequential pattern of elements.

- MovementSequence
    - PlantingSeqence
- RouteSequence
- NeuroSequence

## Element Decomposition

A full body movement can be broken down into 

### Element Mixture Decomposition

Breaking down an element into more simple elements.

::: tip Example:

InsertTree = TreeGrip + BendOver + ShovelProp

:::

### Element Sequence Decomposition

Breaking down the sequence of elements.

::: tip Example: 

OpenHole = LookAtTarget --> ShovelProbeThrow --> ShovelThrow --> ShovelOpenHole
