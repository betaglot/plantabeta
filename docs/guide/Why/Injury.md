# Prevent Injury

## Lost Time due to Injury

Planting can be a dangerous job.

- Injury due to lack of knowledge

## Choose Safer Alternatives

Plantors can get injured when they don't adapt MOTONS to the specific situation. <beta>PlantaBeta</beta> gives many options to adapt MOTONS for any situation.

<p>Some Plantors only know how to <BB :b="{ l:'Klose',s:'Hand',e:'',v:'',m:'', a:''}"/> one way, but there are many different ways. Even slightly varying a MOTONS can reduce repetitive strain injuries.</p>

## Repetitive Strain

Injury can occur in Plantors when they perform the same movement repeatedly.

- Do ambidextrous Plantors suffer less injury caused by repetitive strain?
    - Repetitive Motion
    - Greater moto variability reduces moto repetition.
        - How many  methods do you know?

## Reduces Injuries from Falling

PlantaBeta teaches Plantors how to move through their ðŸŸ©<ekos>EKOS</ekos> safely.

Falling is a large part of Climbing. <beta>PlantaBeta</beta> transfers the knowledge of how to fall safely from climbing to Planting.

## Wrist Tendonitis

Wrist Tendonitis occurs from straining the tissues around the wrist. The strain can be acute, such as when a Plantor hits a rock with full force and doesn't absorb the shock, or the strain can be from repetitive use.

## Christmas Toe

Plantors kick To remove the layer of organic material off an intended microsite. Christmas Toe is when your big toe becomes numb from all the kicking impacts and you only regain sensation around Christmas time (six months after the season is over). Christmas Toe not only affects feet, it also affects how Plantors walk therefore affecting the biomechanics of the entire lower body.

A greater knowledge of possible alternative moves can prevent Christmas Toe from ever occuring.
