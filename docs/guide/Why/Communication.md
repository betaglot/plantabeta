# <beta>Better Communication</beta>

## Greater Vocabulary

Be able to describe more experiences.

## Greater Precision

Pinpoint the specific part of a Planter's experience.

## More Concise

Use single words instead of phrases when useful, but not as a rule. There's no point in shortening if it decreases comprehension.

## Increase Clarity
>
> How much of your piece is Covered?

## Better Instructions

An increased vocabulary and standardization of communication improves the effectiveness of instructions.

### Planters Communicating with Themselves

Plantbeta increases the vocabulary of a Planter's internal dialog which improves [short term memory](/reference/Neuro/Memory/ShortTermMemory) of Planter's experience.

### Planter Communicating with Other Planters

[TeamPlant](/reference/Via/TeamPlant/Overview)

### Supervisor Communicating with Planters

Instructions

When cutting pieces.

" Line in over there." = "Start over there"

*Over where?*
