# Productivity


## Effectiveness

> the degree to which something is successful in producing a desired result.

Planters who plant good quality trees, who don't need to go back into their land to replant faulty trees.

## Efficiency

> the quality of achieving the largest amount of useful work using as little energy, fuel, effort, etc. as possible.

A greater Planter efficiency leads to:

- A shorter season
- PlantingRate
    - Daily Trees in the Ground
- Fewer Planters required to Cover an Eco
- Fewer Motos performed by Planter, therefore less Metabolic Energy used.
- Less [Deadwalking]()
- Fewer Injury
- More efficient vias
- Effective [Flagging]() 
    - Flag which is more visible.
    - Lower Flag expense

::: danger Unteachable Character Traits

A Planter can know everything about how to be a Planter, but still not plant to their maximum potential. This is because to be an elite Planter you must have character traits which can't be taught. Perhaps they can be cultivated by a sports psychologist, but this is currently outside the scope of Plantbeta and the rest of the planting industry.  

Such traits include: 

- Resilience
- Competitiveness
- Grit
- Confidence
- Drive
