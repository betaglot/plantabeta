All Elements have Attributes and Methods

Attributes and Methods are not Elements

A method can be a Problema

## Elements of each BetaType

- 🔷<beta>BETUM</beta>
- 🟠<move>MOVEN</move>
- 🔻<via>VIUM</via>
- 🟩<eko>EKON</eko>
- 💜<psike>NEURO</psike>

## Taxonomy of Elements

- Symbols
    - The methods of symbols connect symbols to another
    - The methods of symbols is their semantics
- Axioms
- Definitions
- Propositions

## Element Combination

(Element_A + Element_B == Element_AB)

Arm + Swing == ArmSwing

Elements combined together become a new element, not a Compound like Chemistry.

## Collection of Elements

- Move collections are called Phrases
- Via collections are called Passages
- Eko collections are called Set, Sections, (Piece,Pitch), Block
- Beta collections are called Blocks
- Psike collections are called Processes

### Element Sequence

- AnteElement
    - Element instantiated before Current Element
- PostElement
    - Element instantiated after Current Element
- ConElement
    - Element instantiated at same Instant as Current Element

## Element Composition

Sequence of Elements

```py
"Element" = AlsoKnownAs([
    "Class",
    "Object",
])

```
