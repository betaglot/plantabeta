# Composition

> something that a person has created or written, esp. a text, a work of art, or a piece of music, or the act of creating or writing something

## Proof

Compositions are prooved to be coherent. You can't have a disjunction. The AnteElement must finish where the CurrentElement starts

## A Composition of Compositions

A ðŸ”·<beta>BETA Composition</beta> is composed of interdependent BetaType Compositions.

## Theatre

The closest thing to a BetaComposition is a Theatre Composition, since:
    - All BetaTypes
    - Performed in one go, unlike film

> ðŸŸ <move>Dance</move> ðŸ”»<via>to the center</via> of ðŸŸ©<eko>the stage</eko> while ðŸ’œ<psike>singing to music</psike>

### The movements of actors is a ðŸŸ <move>MOVE Composition</move>

### Stage Directions a ðŸ”»<via>VIA Composition</via>

### Scenery is an ðŸŸ©<eko>EKO Composition</eko>

### Music and Speech are ðŸ’œ<psike>NEURO Compositions</psike>

## Elements of a Composition

A composition must have a start and finish, although the start and finish can be the same, like an infinite loop

## What is the difference between Composition and Proposition?

Proposition and Compositions both are dependent on earlier elements.

There are no proofs in a composition

## The compositions of architecture are buildings

The compositions of Architecture aren't usually LinearBeta (unless it's a bridge)

NonLinear

Architecture is NonLinear like BETAKOSMOS while Music (except Jazz) is Linear like BETA

## Choreography

## Music Composition

Motif

Fugue

Sonata

Symphony

Etude

## Visual Composition

## ðŸŸ©<eko>MiseEnScene</eko>

- the type of place and situation in which the action of a film or play happens
- French, mise en scÃ¨ne literally means "the action of putting onto the stage." The term's use originated in stage drama, where it refers to the way actors and scenery props are arranged; as its usage expanded into other narrative arts, its meaning shifted. In film production, mise en scÃ¨ne refers to all of the elements that comprise a single shot; that includes, but is not limited to, the actors, setting, props, costumes, and lighting. The director of a play or film is called the metteur en scÃ¨neâ€”literally, "one who puts on the stage."
