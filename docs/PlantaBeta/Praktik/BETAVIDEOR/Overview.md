# 🔷<beta>BetaVideo</beta>

## Purpose

- A video of every BetaElement

## Captions

Beta as CaptionData. BetaCaptions are more useful when watching at Slow Frame Rate.

### ImplicitBeta

BetaCaptions and not just movement captions. Decide what to caption by using Information Theory

> Communicate the information which can't be predicted, interpolated, implied

Less detail isn't necessarily a bad thing

### ExplicitBeta

## Timestamps

BetaVideo can be quickly jumped around like [HubermanLab timestamps](https://www.hubermanlab.com/episode/dr-cal-newport-how-to-enhance-focus-and-improve-productivity) or [RealPython courses](https://realpython.com/lessons/when-to-use-classes-python/#t=120.12). Youtube as a Database so you don't have to store the videos and deal with moving such a large DataObject around the internet.
