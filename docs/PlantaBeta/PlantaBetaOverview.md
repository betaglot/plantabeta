# <beta>What is PLANTABETA?</beta>

> PLANTABETA or "BETA" for short, is the **information** that you use to perform planting tasks.

<beta>BETA</beta> emerges from the interactions between <ekos>EKOS</ekos>, <motor>MOTON</motor>, <via>Via</via> and <anima>Anima</anima>.

## <beta>PLANTABETA Symbol</beta>

::: details Why is it called <beta>Beta</beta>?

## Etymology of "<beta>BETA</beta>" and "<beta>PLANTABETA</beta>"

Betamax was a piece of hardware (similar to a VHS tape or cassete) which was used by climbers to record video of themselves climbing a rock. Climbers would share their Betamax tapes to give their friends information about how to climb a piece of rock.  

- If you're a climber, then you're likely familiar with the term "beta"

> In climbing _beta_ is the information about the _motos_, _sequences_, and _holds_ of a climb. If someone asks you for a climb's beta, then they want to know how you climbed it.

> Beta could be something as simple as the general type of _holds_, like “it’s all slopers” or just the type of rock and length.

> Beta in climbing can be very detailed down to the exact way you _Mano_ a specific hold i.e. “pinch the left side with your first two fingers so there’s space to match with your other hand”.

## Analogy between Climbing and Planting

This each line are analog pairs. The equal signs = denotes where Climbing and Planting are exactly the same.

## How is it useful to relate Climbing to Planting?

- OffSeason Training
- Outdoor Climbing has a similar to Planting.
- Many Plantors are also Climbers and share many attributes.
    - Resilience, Ruggedness, Physically Fit
- You will get better at one by learning the other.

[BetaSequence](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#sequence-types-list-tuple-range)

- TeamPut() is Beta
- You don't need Beta to be a TreePlantor. Beta is just a Wrapper for communication. It's an API, an Interface between you and your coworkers.
- Use Code snippets to write abbreviated names to insert Tags or ElementName

- Independent Modules
    - Eko is not required for Attention
    - BodyBend does not require Via
    - Some Anima only uses NeuroConcepts, like Emotional Regulation. If a function uses more than one module then it is Beta.

- Everything is an Object, like Python

> Beta is what you actually do implement
> Elements are just options possibilities
> Beta requires decision

Each PlantaBeta module is composed of problems and theorems. Problems all have solutions, they aren't proven valid yet, but are still useful for development. Pertainent negative. Science proves hypotheses wrong. NullHypotheses.

Eko doesn't have any problems or theorems

- Strategy
    - Plan of Action

Beta can be a description or an instruction

- "Beta.BetaEvent"
- "Beta.BetaInstance"
- "Beta.BetaInstance.BetaInstanceComparison"
- "Beta.BetaName"
- "Beta.BetaAttributes.BetaAccuracy"
- "Beta.BetaAttributes.BetaPrecision"
- "Beta.BetaAttributes.BetaType"
- "Beta.BetaAttributes.ElementCount"
- "Beta.BetaAttributes.SubsystemCount"
- "Beta.BetaQuestion"
- "Beta.Overview"

There are no units of Beta, except for Tokens

Token, Block, Module

Only Beta can be the solution

Via Theorem, Via Solution

Via just gives the options, Beta is required to Solve, since solution requires MOTON. Beta occurs when more than module is required in 1stPersonPoint of view. Plantor's perspective.

Anima that just thinks about AnimaElements

- Separate the semantics by inflecting "beta", like "beton, betons"
    - Beta is:
        - An Experience: BETA PRAKTIK
            - thought can be the experience
                - calming yourself down is beta
                    - I need to stay calm
                - ERROR: you can also think about thinking
                    "I psyched myself out"
            - being the beta
                - living the beta
                - embodying the beta
            - That beta didn't work
            - I'm going to copy your beta
            - Implementation
            - Execution
        - A representation of the Experience: BETA TEORI
            - Spectating Beta
                - Watch them practice
                    - Watching their Praktik, but not participating in the Praktik
                - You don't Experience their beta, since it's impossible to directly experience someone else's Anima. It's impossible to know if the color that you name "red" is the same color as someone else's "red".
            - Abstraction
                - Skema
                - Thought
            - Video
            - Speech
                - What synonym for speech is totally analog?
                    - in person
                - Asking for beta
                - Talking about beta with another person

You don't give Motor

You give beta praktik

Can you give me some beta teori
