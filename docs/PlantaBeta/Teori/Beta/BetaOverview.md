::: details Etymology of "<beta>BETA</beta>" and "<beta>BETUM</beta>"

Betamax was a piece of hardware (similar to a VHS tape or cassete) which was used by climbers to record video of themselves climbing a rock. Climbers would share their Betamax tapes to give their friends information about how to climb a piece of rock.  

- If you're a climber, then you're likely familiar with the term "beta"

> In climbing _beta_ is the information about the _motos_, _sequences_, and _holds_ of a climb. If someone asks you for a climb's BETA, then they want to know how you climbed it.

> BETA could be something as simple as the general type of _holds_, like “it’s all slopers” or just the type of rock and length.

> BETA in climbing can be very detailed down to the exact way you _Mano_ a specific hold i.e. “pinch the left side with your first two fingers so there’s space to match with your other hand”.
