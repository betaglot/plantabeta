# 🔷<beta>ELEMENT</beta>

All Elements have Attributes and Methods

Attributes and Methods are not Elements

A method can be a Problema

## Elements of each BetaType

- 🔷<beta>BETUM</beta>
- 🟠<motor>MOTON</motor>
- 🔻<via>VIUM</via>
- 🟩<ekos>EKON</ekos>
- 💜<anima>Anima</anima>
- ⭐<labos>LABOR</labos>

## Taxonomy of Elements

- Simbols
    - The methods of symbols connect symbols to another
    - The methods of symbols is their semantics
- Axioms
- Definitions
- Propositions

## Element Combination

(Element_A + Element_B == Element_AB)

Arm + Swing == ArmSwing

Elements combined together become a new element, not a Compound like Chemistry.

## Collection of Elements

- MOTON collections are called Phrases
- Via collections are called Passages
- Eko collections are called Set, Sections, (Piece,Pitch), Block
- Beta collections are called Blocks
- Anima collections are called Processes

### Element Sequence

- AnteElement
    - Element instantiated before Current Element
- PostElement
    - Element instantiated after Current Element
- ConElement
    - Element instantiated at same Instant as Current Element

## Element Composition

Sequence of Elements

```py
"Element" = AlsoKnownAs([
    "Class",
    "Object",
])

```

There are no duplicate Elements
