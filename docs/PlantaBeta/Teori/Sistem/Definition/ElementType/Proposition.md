# Proposition

## Definition(**Proposition**)

> an offer or suggestion
---
> an idea or opinion
---
> a statement or problem that must be solved or proved to be **either** true or not true.

### Definition(Proof)

> a fact or piece of information that shows that something exists or is true
---
> A mathematical proof is a deductive argument for a mathematical statement, showing that the stated assumptions logically guarantee the conclusion

New objects can be introduced to prove a statement

### Derivations of **Proposition**

## Differentiate(Problema, Theorema)

### Definition(Problema)

> Given some set of initial objects, a problem shows how to do something (say, how to find, to draw, to set out) and then demonstrates that what has been done is satisfactory

#### Definition(Solve)

### Definition(Theorema)

> Given some set of inital objects, a theorem asserts some property that is true of these objects
---
> a formal statement that can be shown to be true by logic
---
> a general proposition not self-evident but proved by a chain of reasoning; a truth established by means of accepted truths

### Similarities

- Both must be valid
- Both are statements

### Differences

#### ReturnStatement

- Problems are questions which must return an answer.
    - 'How to make an equilateral triangle' returns an equilateral triangle.
    - 'How to '
- Theorems don't return anything.
    - "If in a triangle two angles equal one another, then the sides opposite the equal angles also equal one another."

## Validity

> the quality of being based on truth or reason, or of being able to be accepted:

It is true that something is false.

## Connect Euclid and Python with Statements

All statements must be valid for them to run in Python.

### Python

> statements are instructions or commands that you write to perform specific actions or tasks

Element.Attributes are Theorems, while Element.Methods are Problems.

PythonStatements are closer to Problema than to Theorema.

Problema:
> a task, that which is proposed, a question

## What is the relationship between Classes and Statements?

> Each Statement is a Class?
---
> Statements contain instances of Elements

Classes are composed of both Problems and Theorems

A ClassDefinition is a Theorem.

All Elements are composed of Theorems(Attributes) and Problems(Methods)

(Problema !=== Problem), (Theorema !=== Theorem)

Problema and Theorema are a Subset of Problems and Theorems, they must be of type Beta

Each Elements is acutally composed of multiple Statements, but in Sistema, Elements are not called Statements. In the same way that all Functions in Python are actually Objects.

All definitions are actually propositions

What the class looks like.

How to perform the class.

Knowing what a HeelHook looks like is not the same thing as knowing how to perform a HeelHook. Both knowing and performing are contained within the HeelHook class.

At a different scope, *'HeelHooks can be used to traverse a ledge'* is a Theorem which itself is not an Element. Unless, like Python, everything is an Object (all objects are classes), so *'HeelHooks can be used to traverse a ledge'* is an class. If each unqiue combination of Elements is a class, then there are millions of unqiue classes in SISTEM. Each class would be contained in a database table.

<beta>*'HeelHooks can be used to traverse a ledge'*</beta> is a BetaStatement composed of instances of Elements from multiple BetaTypes:

- üü†<motor>HeelHook</motor>
- üîª<via>Traverse</via>
- üü©<ekos>Ledge</ekos>

BetaStatements are not Elements, only the Statements of BetaTypes can be Elements.

BetaStatements which haven't been proven true are Hypotheses. Proven Hypotheses are Theorems.

Knowledge of Geometry is assumed.
