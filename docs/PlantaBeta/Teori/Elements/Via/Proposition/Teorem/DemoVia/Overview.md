When Plantors share the same piece of Land they are TeamPlanting, currently known as "Partner Planting" or if there are more than a couple other Plantors "Cattle Planting". "Cattle Planting" refers to the situation where cattle a herd of cattle gaze randomly across a piece of land and has a connotation of chaotic Routing. "Cattle Planting" is not a useful term because it does not encourage team work.

Team members only share Via, they don't share MOTON (nobody plants a single Neon as a team), therefore "Team Planting"
