### Two Systems

#### System 1: Fast, automatic, frequent, emotional, stereotypic, unconscious. Examples (in order of complexity) of things system 1 can do:

- determine that an object is at a greater distance than another
- localize the source of a specific sound
- complete the phrase "war and ..."
- display disgust when seeing a gruesome image
- solve 2+2=?
- read text on a billboard
- drive a car on an empty road
- think of a good chess move (if you're a chess master)
- understand simple sentences
- associate the description 'quiet and structured person with an eye for details' with a specific job

#### System 2: Slow, effortful, infrequent, logical, calculating, conscious. Examples of things system 2 can do:

- prepare yourself for the start of a sprint
- direct your attention towards the clowns at the circus
- direct your attention towards someone at a loud party
- look for the woman with the grey hair
- try to recognize a sound
- sustain a faster-than-normal walking rate
- determine the appropriateness of a particular behavior in a social setting
- count the number of A's in a certain text
- give someone your telephone number
- park into a tight parking space
- determine the price/quality ratio of two washing machines
- determine the validity of a complex logical reasoning
- solve 17 Ã— 24
