## ðŸŸ©<ekos>MiseEnScene</ekos>

- the type of place and situation in which the action of a film or play happens
- French, mise en scÃ¨ne literally means "the action of putting onto the stage." The term's use originated in stage drama, where it refers to the way actors and scenery props are arranged; as its usage expanded into other narrative arts, its meaning shifted. In film production, mise en scÃ¨ne refers to all of the elements that comprise a single shot; that includes, but is not limited to, the actors, setting, props, costumes, and lighting. The director of a play or film is called the metteur en scÃ¨neâ€”literally, "one who puts on the stage."

## Fashion
