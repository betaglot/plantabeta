## What does every Novice do before they go planting?

Novice Planters ALWAYS Google "How to Plant trees?" before starting the season. Why? To educate themselves as much as possible before starting work, because they know that the more knowledge they have about planting the more money they will make.

The best resource which can be found is Replant.ca, but this site could be better.

- The [Dictionary](http://www.replant.ca/dictionary.html) has no images.
- The book [Step By Step](https://jonathan-scooter-clark.blogspot.com/2018/03/step-by-step.html) only has a couple chapters about how to actually plant trees AND you need to pay for it. I've personally bought two editions of the book and neither are useful to the Planters themselves, it seems like the book is more useful to people like yourselves who run planting companies.
- Their [videos](https://jonathan-scooter-clark.blogspot.com/2017/02/tree-Planter-training-learning-how-to.html) are not very useful.


## What is PutPlant?

- PutPlant is a web app which contains all the information that a Planter needs to know to perform their job in the [Reference](/reference/Overview) section. 
- PutPlant has a [Tests](/tests/Overview) section for Planters to reinforce their knowledge and to find any gaps in their knowledge.
- Unlike Replant.ca, PutPlant contains no information about the business side of planting, it's only from the Planter's perspective. 
- Each element of PutPlant has its own profile. Currently you will see placeholders for each section of the profile. Each element profile has a profile picture, element description, a relationship graph showing how it relates to elements from the other subsystems, descriptions of how elements from other subsystems relate to the current element and at the bottom of the profile there are links to related elements (like the "See Also" section in Wikipedia pages). Not only are Planters shown all the elements, but more importantly they are shown how they relate to each other. Some elements are highly related to such as Attention (NeuroElement), while others are not related to other subsystems such as TreeLoad (grabbing a tree from your bag).
    - [PocketArea](/reference/Eco/Area/PocketArea.md)
        - It's more efficient to AreaCover than PerimeterCover (ViaElements) a PocketArea.
        - You need to define the boundaries of the area (NeuroElement).
    - [HandScreef](/reference/Moto/HandMoto/HandScreef)
        - The SoilType (EcoElement) determines if you SpadeScreef or HandScreef.
        - You need to see and feel (NeuroElements) where the duff layer becomes MineralSoil to perform an effective HandScreef.
    - [BackCover](/reference/Via/PieceCover/BackCover)
        - The shape of the Piece (EcoElement) determines if you want to BackCover or AreaCover.
    - [BagUpSizeDecision](/reference/Neuro/Decision/BagUpSizeDecision)
        - The Eco affects the BagUpSize, bigger BagUpSize for straight trenches (EcoElement) compared to RawLand (EcoElement).
        - BagUpSize depends on how fatigued (Neuro) you are.
        - BagUpSize affects how fast you can move (MotoElement) and how easily you can climb over slash (EcoElement).
        - If you need to BackCover (ViaElement) a piece then you typically have a large BagUpSize.

## How is PutPlant Innovative and Educational?

> Work smarter not harder

- PutPlant is **FREE** educational resource for Planters.
- PutPlant explains how to plant in greater nuance than ever before, by breaking down a Planter's experience into 4 interdependent subsystems:
    - Eco System
    - Moto System
    - Routing System
        - Also known as 'Land Management'
    - Neuro System

- PutPlant is innovative since it uses evidence based knowledge from the [Huberman Lab Podcast](https://hubermanlab.com/). The podcast is run by the [Andrew Huberman](https://hubermanlab.com/about/) who is a highly respected university professor from California. Some of the topics which are directly applicable to planting are: 
    - [Fitness](https://hubermanlab.com/guest-series-dr-andy-galpin-maximize-recovery-to-achieve-fitness-and-performance-goals/), how to build muscle, how to recover, how to use supplments, how to train endurance, how the body converts food into energy.
    - [Sleep](https://hubermanlab.com/sleep-toolkit-tools-for-optimizing-sleep-and-sleep-wake-timing/)
    - [Salt](https://hubermanlab.com/using-salt-to-optimize-mental-and-physical-performance/), the importance of salt for mental and physical performance.
    - [Learning](https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-learn-skills-faster/), how to learn faster and more deeply.
    - [Caffeine](https://hubermanlab.com/using-caffeine-to-optimize-mental-and-physical-performance/), how to use caffeine to optimize mental and physical performance... and how to not overdo it.


## How does PutPlant provide Value to Quastuco?

> "We take pride in our work and reputation as we strive to be one of the most efficient and innovative companies on the market"

- PutPlant will increase Quastuco's reputation, since Quastuco's logo is prominently displayed on the home page and on every other page, therefore advertising Quastuco to every user, everytime they use the app. With a greater amount of advertising comes a greater number of applicants, so you can be more selective in your hiring process.
- You, Bunky and the OverEco family, could be the Planters in the moto element photos if you wanted.
- Quastuco can be one who posts an annoucement PutPlant to King Kong Reforestation.

<pre>


</pre>

> "When all our systems are in place, you as the Planter will meet your goals."

- PutPlant systematizes a Planter's education. PutPlant will reduce the time it takes for Novices to learn how to plant, therefore increasing Quastuco's planting rate.

<pre>


</pre>

> "Statement of Goals and Objective - 2023 Safety Improvement Plan...
Flagging reduction, the goal is a 60% reduction in single use plastics...Veteran Planters will be provided with techniques to reduce their flagging use"

- PutPlant will increase the value of experienced Planters, by identifying then Covering in their knowledge gaps.

## Update Quastuco.com

### In addition to PutPlant, Quastuco would benefit from the development of Quastuco.com.
- The new site would use [Material Design 3 ]('https://m3.material.io/') standards which were published in Nov 2022. Material Design is what Google and Youtube use to style their websites and is the cutting edge of web design. Update Quastuco's site now to the current cutting edge and you won't need to update it for a long time. If the current site is kept the way it is, then it will look ancient in 5 years.
- The [Photos](https://www.quastuco.com/photos/) section of your website doesn't work, a blank screen is rendered and images can only been seen one at a time if you click on the blank area. 
- Update the photos used on the website.
- Quastuco has a Facebook page which has a good design, but Gen Z doesn't use Facebook, so, future Planters won't see it. 
    - [NBC news](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/gen-z-facebook-pew-research-center-finds-rcna42429)
- Other planting companies have well designed websites
    - [OutEco Website](https://www.outEcoplanting.ca/)
    - [Brinkman Website](https://www.brinkmanreforestation.ca/)

::: danger Ok...
#  These are good ideas, but how can you TRUST that I can deliver?
:::

- I'm very passionate about making PutPlant. I've been designing ways to improve planting since my first year here eight years ago, when I designed a flagging device. I've also created multiple innovative prototypes of planting bags. All of these projects were designed in my own time, because I wanted to make them. 
- This summer I will be getting an [official certification](https://certification.vuejs.org/) in the programming language that runs PutPlant. I've already pre ordered the certification, but the exam isn't ready yet. PutPlant will be a project that I will use in my design portfolio, when looking for employment throughout my design career.
    - Vue.js, is the programming language being used for PutPlant. It is one of the most popular and therefore one of the largest communities for web development, so if there are any programming obstacles that I can't figure out myself, then I'll be able to get help from the community.  
- I've already made dozens of pages of designs for PutPlant, but I haven't gotten the opportunity to implement them into a web app. 
- There are many other planting projects which I'd like to work with Quastuco to implement in the years to come, such as:
    - Paper flagging tape which doesn't fall off branches, so the flag is highly visible and therefore fewer flags are needed. Also the paper won't be as toxic to the earth as plastic flagging tape. 
    - Gloves which are specifically designed for Planters.
    - Making a pro deal with Patagonia clothing.
    - Adding a section to PutPlant for Supervisors.
    - Using AI to optimize planting.
    - Create a guide for Planter Instructors. 
    - Creating a position for a person who repairs Planter's clothing and boots to increase their longevity. A torn stitch in a boot could be repaired before it grows and reduces a Planter's performance. 


## So, how do we make this happen?

### Research during this current season 2023 {#title1} 

#### Photography
- Take photos of Eco from the ground and from the air (with Jess's help), then abstract them into Eco Diagrams.
- Take photos and videos of Planters for Moto and Via Element Profiles. 

#### Recording Observations

- What are the most common ways that Planters lose time?
- What parts of the Eco does NoviceStare most frequently occur?
- Expand the EcoSystem section, adding more microsite types to PutPlant.
- HighBaller Observation
    - Identify individual strengths and weaknesses.
    - How do HighBallers plant more trees? How much has to do with moto speed and how much to do with Routing (Land Management)?
- LowBaller Observation
    - Identify individual strengths and weaknesses.
    - Observe what makes them slow and record it using the elements of PutPlant.


#### Asking Planters and Supervisors Questions

- What is going on in their heads when Novices NoviceStare?
- What PutPlant elements have Novices never heard of?
- What would Planters want from Planbeta?
- What are the most common quality faults that supervisors observe?
- How do Planters plan their piece?
 
## Web Development During the OffSeason {#title2}

From the end of this planting season to end of next season, I'll be making PutPlant and building Quastuco's new website. Some of the task will be: 
- Building Quastuco.com
- Editing videos of Motos into Gifs and Photos
- Editing and inserting photos into ElementProfiles
- Making EcoDiagrams from EcoPhotos
- Writing all the text for PutPlant.
- Building the Tests.
- Graphing the relationships between elements

In time for the start of the 2024 hiring, Quastuco.com will be ready by the end of October along with a selection of the most important PutPlant Elements. The rest of the elements will be completed by the end of June 2024.
