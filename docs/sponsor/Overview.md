# Become a [Plantbeta](/guide/What/WhatPlantbeta) Sponsor

Plantbeta is completely free to use. The tremendous amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features for the project is only made sustainable thanks to the generous financial backing of our sponsors.

##  These are good ideas, but how can you TRUST that I can deliver?
:::

- I'm very passionate about making Plantbeta. I've been designing ways to improve planting since my first year here eight years ago, when I designed a flagging device. I've also created multiple innovative prototypes of planting bags. All of these projects were designed in my own time, because I wanted to make them. 
- This summer I will be getting an [official certification](https://certification.vuejs.org/) in the programming language that runs Plantbeta. I've already pre ordered the certification, but the exam isn't ready yet. Plantbeta will be a project that I will use in my design portfolio, when looking for employment throughout my design career.
    - Vue.js, is the programming language being used for Plantbeta. It is one of the most popular and therefore one of the largest communities for web development, so if there are any programming obstacles that I can't figure out myself, then I'll be able to get help from the community.  
- I've already made dozens of pages of designs for Plantbeta, but I haven't gotten the opportunity to implement them into a web app. 


- There are many other planting projects which I'd like to implement in the years to come, such as:
    - Paper flagging tape which doesn't fall off branches, so the flag is highly visible and therefore fewer flags are needed. Also the paper won't be as toxic to the earth as plastic flagging tape. 
    - Gloves which are specifically designed for planters.
    - Making a pro deal with Patagonia clothing.
    - Adding a section to Plantbeta for Supervisors.
    - Using AI to optimize planting.
    - Create a guide for Planter Instructors. 
    - Creating a position for a person who repairs planter's clothing and boots to increase their longevity. A torn stitch in a boot could be repaired before it grows and reduces a planter's performance. 








#### Photography
- Take photos of Environment from the ground and from the air, then abstract them into Environment Diagrams.
- Take photos and videos of Planters for Move and Route Element Profiles. 

#### Recording Observations

- What are the most common ways that planters lose time?
- What parts of the Environment does RookieStare most frequently occur?
- Expand the EnvironmentSubsystem section, adding more microsite types to Plantbeta.
- HighBaller Observation
    - Identify individual strengths and weaknesses.
    - How do HighBallers plant more trees? How much has to do with movement speed and how much to do with Routing (Land Management)?
- LowBaller Observation
    - Identify individual strengths and weaknesses.
    - Observe what makes them slow and record it using the elements of Plantbeta.


#### Asking Planters and Supervisors Questions

- What is going on in their heads when Rookies RookieStare?
- What Plantbeta elements have rookies never heard of?
- What would planters want from Planbeta?
- What are the most common quality faults that supervisors observe?
- How do planters plan their piece?
 
## Web Development During the OffSeason 

From the end of this planting season to end of next season, I'll be making Plantbeta and building Quastuco's new website. Some of the task will be: 
- Editing videos of Moves into Gifs and Photos
- Editing and inserting photos into ElementProfiles
- Making EnvironmentDiagrams from EnvironmentPhotos
- Writing all the text for Plantbeta.
- Building the Tests.
- Graphing the relationships between elements
