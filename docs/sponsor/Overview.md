::: tip You're gonna think...
- That I can't deliver on my promises.
- You’re gonna think that this is more complicated than it needs to be.
- You’re gonna think that this is too much for a Rookie to take in.
- You're gonna think that a web app can't make people better planters.
- You're gonna think that I'm not qualified.

## What does every rookie do before they go planting?

Rookie planters ALWAYS Google "How to Plant trees?" before starting the season. Why? To educate themselves as much as possible before starting work, because they know that the more knowledge they have about planting the more money they will make.

The best resource which can be found is Replant.ca, but this site could be better.

- The [Dictionary](http://www.replant.ca/dictionary.html) has no images.
- The book [Step By Step](https://jonathan-scooter-clark.blogspot.com/2018/03/step-by-step.html) only has a couple chapters about how to actually plant trees AND you need to pay for it. I've personally bought two editions of the book and neither are useful to the planters themselves, it seems like the book is more useful to people like yourselves who run planting companies.
- Their [videos](https://jonathan-scooter-clark.blogspot.com/2017/02/tree-planter-training-learning-how-to.html) are not very precise.


## What is Plantbeta?

- Plantbeta is a web app which contains all the information that a planter needs to know to perform their job in the [Reference](/reference/Overview) section. 
- Plantbeta has a [Tests](/tests/Overview) section for planters to reinforce their knowledge and to find any gaps in their knowledge.
- Unlike Replant.ca, Plantbeta contains no information about the business side of planting, it's only from the planter's perspective. 
- Each element of Plantbeta has its own profile. Currently you will see placeholders for each section of the profile. Each element profile has a profile picture, element description, a relationship graph showing how it relates to elements from the other subsystems, descriptions of how elements from other subsystems relate to the current element and at the bottom of the profile there are links to related elements (like the "See Also" section in Wikipedia pages). Not only are planters shown all the elements, but more importantly they are shown how they relate to each other. Some elements are highly related to such as Attention (NeuroElement), while others are not related to other subsystems such as TreeLoad (grabbing a tree from your bag).
    - [PocketArea](/reference/Land/Area/PocketArea.md)
        - It's more efficient to AreaFill than PerimeterFill (RouteElements) a PocketArea.
        - You need to define the boundaries of the area (NeuroElement).
    - [HandScreef](/reference/Movement/HandMovement/HandScreef)
        - The SoilType (LandElement) determines if you ShovelScreef or HandScreef.
        - You need to see and feel (NeuroElements) where the duff layer becomes MineralSoil to perform an effective HandScreef.
    - [BackFill](/reference/Route/PieceFill/BackFill)
        - The shape of the Piece (LandElement) determines if you want to BackFill or AreaFill.
    - [BagUpSizeDecision](/reference/Neuro/Decision/BagUpSizeDecision)
        - The land affects the BagUpSize, bigger BagUpSize for straight trenches (LandElement) compared to RawLand (LandElement).
        - BagUpSize depends on how fatigued (Neuro) you are.
        - BagUpSize affects how fast you can move (MovementElement) and how easily you can climb over slash (LandElement).
        - If you need to BackFill (RouteElement) a piece then you typically have a large BagUpSize.

## How is Plantbeta Innovative and Educational?

> Work smarter not harder

- Plantbeta is **FREE** educational resource for planters.
- Plantbeta explains how to plant in greater nuance than ever before, by breaking down a planter's experience into 4 interdependent subsystems:
    - Land System
    - Movement System
    - Routing System
        - Also known as 'Land Management'
    - Neuro System

- Plantbeta is innovative since it uses evidence based knowledge from the [Huberman Lab Podcast](https://hubermanlab.com/). The podcast is run by the [Andrew Huberman](https://hubermanlab.com/about/) who is a highly respected university professor from California. Some of the topics which are directly applicable to planting are: 
    - [Fitness](https://hubermanlab.com/guest-series-dr-andy-galpin-maximize-recovery-to-achieve-fitness-and-performance-goals/), how to build muscle, how to recover, how to use supplments, how to train endurance, how the body converts food into energy.
    - [Sleep](https://hubermanlab.com/sleep-toolkit-tools-for-optimizing-sleep-and-sleep-wake-timing/)
    - [Salt](https://hubermanlab.com/using-salt-to-optimize-mental-and-physical-performance/), the importance of salt for mental and physical performance.
    - [Learning](https://hubermanlab.com/how-to-learn-skills-faster/), how to learn faster and more deeply.
    - [Caffeine](https://hubermanlab.com/using-caffeine-to-optimize-mental-and-physical-performance/), how to use caffeine to optimize mental and physical performance... and how to not overdo it.

##  These are good ideas, but how can you TRUST that I can deliver?
:::

- I'm very passionate about making Plantbeta. I've been designing ways to improve planting since my first year here eight years ago, when I designed a flagging device. I've also created multiple innovative prototypes of planting bags. All of these projects were designed in my own time, because I wanted to make them. 
- This summer I will be getting an [official certification](https://certification.vuejs.org/) in the programming language that runs Plantbeta. I've already pre ordered the certification, but the exam isn't ready yet. Plantbeta will be a project that I will use in my design portfolio, when looking for employment throughout my design career.
    - Vue.js, is the programming language being used for Plantbeta. It is one of the most popular and therefore one of the largest communities for web development, so if there are any programming obstacles that I can't figure out myself, then I'll be able to get help from the community.  
- I've already made dozens of pages of designs for Plantbeta, but I haven't gotten the opportunity to implement them into a web app. 


- There are many other planting projects which I'd like to implement in the years to come, such as:
    - Paper flagging tape which doesn't fall off branches, so the flag is highly visible and therefore fewer flags are needed. Also the paper won't be as toxic to the earth as plastic flagging tape. 
    - Gloves which are specifically designed for planters.
    - Making a pro deal with Patagonia clothing.
    - Adding a section to Plantbeta for Supervisors.
    - Using AI to optimize planting.
    - Create a guide for Planter Instructors. 
    - Creating a position for a person who repairs planter's clothing and boots to increase their longevity. A torn stitch in a boot could be repaired before it grows and reduces a planter's performance. 


#### Photography
- Take photos of land from the ground and from the air, then abstract them into Land Diagrams.
- Take photos and videos of Planters for Movement and Route Element Profiles. 

#### Recording Observations

- What are the most common ways that planters lose time?
- What parts of the land does RookieStare most frequently occur?
- Expand the LandSystem section, adding more microsite types to Plantbeta.
- HighBaller Observation
    - Identify individual strengths and weaknesses.
    - How do HighBallers plant more trees? How much has to do with movement speed and how much to do with Routing (Land Management)?
- LowBaller Observation
    - Identify individual strengths and weaknesses.
    - Observe what makes them slow and record it using the elements of Plantbeta.


#### Asking Planters and Supervisors Questions

- What is going on in their heads when Rookies RookieStare?
- What Plantbeta elements have rookies never heard of?
- What would planters want from Planbeta?
- What are the most common quality faults that supervisors observe?
- How do planters plan their piece?
 
## Web Development During the OffSeason 

From the end of this planting season to end of next season, I'll be making Plantbeta and building Quastuco's new website. Some of the task will be: 
- Editing videos of Movements into Gifs and Photos
- Editing and inserting photos into ElementProfiles
- Making LandDiagrams from LandPhotos
- Writing all the text for Plantbeta.
- Building the Tests.
- Graphing the relationships between elements
