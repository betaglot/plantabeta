### Algorithm

### Data

### Input/Output

- Return Value

## Computational Neuroscience

## Computational Geometry

> Computational geometry is a branch of computer science devoted to the study of algorithms which can be stated in terms of geometry. Some purely geometrical problems arise out of the study of computational geometric algorithms, and such problems are also considered to be part of computational geometry.


### Graph Theory

- Nearest Neighbor
- Minimum Spanning Tree

### Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation


## Computer Science




- What are the computations that planters use?

- Just like Python, all objects in a planter's experience are objects.
