## Value of PlantbetaElements to Other PlantbetaElements

::: warning Not Value of Plantbeta in general

The properties and actions of an element gives value 

All elements are interdependent. 

:::

Elements are only valuable if they can be used to solve essential a Problems or fulfill essential needs. 

The fuel of Planting. Data, Knowledge, MetabolicEnergy, Seedlings, Microsite, Product, Service


Value Producer

Value Consumer

### Example of a Value


- Text
    - RequiredMove
    - Force required
    - Direction of travel
    - Instruction for what to do next.
- Number
    - Density
    - TreeCount
    - RouteSequenceNumber
    - MoveSequenceNumber
    - StepCount
- Location
    - TargetLocation in the Land.
    - PotentialMicrosite
    - 
- Array
    - MoveSequence
    - Set of Submoves
    - RouteSequence

### Outcome > Output

False value is a bunch of features that planters don't use. The value of a stump is not its color (HexadecimalValue, RGB values), rather value comes from the stump's PotentialMicrosites. The RouteElement(PotentialMicrosite, FlagSite) gives the LandElement(Stump) value

Theorem the name of an object, while Problem is the object's values and methods.



### What are the needs of Move?

- Energy to move.
- Knowing where to go
    - Route
- Knowing how to move
    - MoveSelection

- Required Tools 
    - A spade is more valuable than an extractor since it can solve more problems more efficiently. A spade solves the same problems as an extractor and can solve even more problems than an extractor.  

### What are the needs of Route?

- Land to plant seedlings.

### What are the needs of Land?

- Seedlings to plant in Land.

### What are the needs of Neuro

- Knowing to pay attention to in the BetaInstance?
- Knowing what to do next.



### Value Exchange

A complex

The value exchange of woven fiber neighbors is the tension force holding each other in place. Warp Weft. ForceExchange.

Subsystems give each other value.

The RouteElement(GoodMicrosite, FlagSite) gives the LandElement(Stump) value. The stump gives Route value by providing PotentialMicrosite.


What does paired element get in return?

### Value Chain

Also known as a Value Stream.

Value is added along a sequence of steps. Like Bioamplification of poison in Predatory Birds 

- Exponential 
- [Addition of MarginalGains Infographic]


#### MoveValue
- Successful SpadeProbe PositiveLandTest. The Spade goes in deep enough to bury the seedling's roots.
- HoleOpen gives value to InsertTree

#### RelativeValue
- TallPersonBeta 
    - "That ContactSurface isn't useful for me"
    - TeamPlant

#### RouteValue

#### LandValue
- RockCap is not valuable for planting.
- CreamyLand

Value is added along the chain of steps. PlantingSequence

MicrositeValidation Threshold MinimumValue
- SoilProperties
- ObstacleFill
- 

Microsite gets more and more valuable until the hole is closed
