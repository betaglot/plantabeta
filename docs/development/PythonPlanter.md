### Algorithm

### Data

### Input/Output

- Return Value

## Computational Neuroscience

## Computational Geometry

> Computational geometry is a branch of computer science devoted to the study of algorithms which can be stated in terms of geometry. Some purely geometrical problems arise out of the study of computational geometric algorithms, and such problems are also considered to be part of computational geometry.


### Graph Theory

- Nearest Neighbor
- Minimum Spanning Tree

### Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation


## Computer Science

- What are the computations that planters use?
- Just like Python, all objects in a planter's experience are objects. 

## Data Types

There is nothing too small to describe with code. Opening a water bottle can have a Sequence List



### Object

Every BetaElement is an object.

### List

- Any Sequence
- 
-

### Dict

- Species Ratio
-


### Tuple
- 
-

### Loop

- Planting Loop 
- Probe Loop
- Microsite Selection Loop
- Counting Loop
- Unwrap Loop
- Cache Construct Loop
- 

### Function
-

## Expressions

## Control Flow Statements

### If Else

- 

## Monty Python References

### Shrubbery

> a plant with a wooden stem and many small branches that usually does not grow very tall

- In the future shrubs will be planted among crop trees to prevent soil erosion.
- In northern Alberta they plant Rhododendron Shrubs (locally known as Labrador Tea)
