## What is <eco>Eco</eco>?

Eco is Geology and Biology

## Etymology

The name of the Eco module is derived from <eco>eco</eco>system

The British Columbian Government's [definition](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/ecosystems):
> An ecosystem is a collection of communities of both living and non-living things that are connected. The biotic elements in an ecosystem include living things such as plants and animals. The abiotic elements found in an ecosystem include non-living things like land forms or climate.

The word "<eco>eco</eco>system" was derived from <eco>eco</eco>logy

> (originally as <eco>oeco</eco>logy ): from Greek <eco>oikos</eco> â€˜houseâ€™ + -logy.

In PutPlant's <beta>Beta system</beta> the <eco>Eco</eco> module represents the <eco>homes</eco> of the seedlings that you're planting.

## DevNotes

- All Land is Eco, but not all Eco is Land. Atmosphere
- Eco a subset of Neuro. Eco is perceived. The map is not the territory. Neuro objectifies earth.
- Eco exists within Awareness
- A meter into the residual is no longer Eco. Eco is only earth that you interact with.
- A storm on the other side of your valley is not Eco.
