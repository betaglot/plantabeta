- Soil overview soil is very important for the tree insert movement it's also important when for foot movements soil can be very crumbly and usually that increases the complexity or actually no it increases the risk crumbly soil increases the risk soil on slopes that are steep increases the risk so steep slope plus crumbly soil is super risky steep slope and ice is really risky is ice car does ice count of soil no wet soil is risky so what I guess what I'm saying or what are the different difficulties of soil what's the easiest soil the less the least strenuous soil I would have to say that the least during your soil is not sand casand is tiring to walk in because it absorbs all of your footsteps so it would have to be some kind of denser sand or I guess wet sand would be okay dry sand definitely not especially if you're on a slope because your feet will just slide back down it's like retrograde motion so yeah I guess the most intense oil Clay is really high intensity not high intensity for walking but high intensity for Spade moves because it's so dense and probably takes a lot of force to separate all of the clay plates clay the way that it forms is basal cleavage so it turns out to be a bunch of flat plates that stick together and that's almost like scale mail armor which makes it difficult to pierce Clay is slippery if you're going along its surface I mean if you're moving parallel to its surface it's slippery but if you're moving perpendicular to it it barely moves at all probably for the same reason I think the the plates probably naturally settle horizontally which is you typically slip horizontally the lowest intensity soil for yes the intensity of soil differs depending on if you're using a spade move or if you're moving if you're using a foot move or leg move or even hand move cuz you could scrape the soil I guess we'll definitely yeah with the shovel screething or Spade screaming so the most intense for a spade move would be clay the least intense for spayed move would be dry sand even wet sand the grain size of soil typically increases the intensity because large grain doesn't move as easily and also a large grain is hard to close that's another thing with the clay is not only is the hole open Move high intensity a lot of force required but the whole clothes is also high intensity and can also be high complexity because the clay sticks to your shovel which is a huge pain in the ass and it also makes your shovel heavier and makes it thicker like the blade more thick which makes it harder to penetrate the ground what's another type of soil wet soil wet soil is also low intensity cuz it's because it's easy to open but it's high complexity because you have to know when the soil is wet wears two wet and where is dry enough to to not be faulted because if your hole opens and it fills with water that counts as a false because it's too wet and trees can't just not all trees can just grow in super wet conditions black spruce can apparently but most other ones can't
