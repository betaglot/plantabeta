- land speed is referring to the speed in which a planter can traverse the land land speed is related to or

- is influenced by how much slash there is it's influenced by the amount of power or force or energy required to move through the land

steeper land is inherently slower land could be described as fast slow closer related to good although you get good and bad although you can have bad land that is fast or maybe not I don't know but you can have good land it's slow typically prep lands unless the trenches are bad trenches usually means that they're not straight that they're not parallel and that they cross each other and diverge and converge a lot bad as blurred out which is kind of funny slow land ry faster slow depending on how wet it is as well usually wetland is slower unless you're in Ontario then it could be faster cuz you'd be planting in sphagnum Moss yeah another thing about land speed is that land speed could be affected by planter size potentially depending on leg length that can legally can affect the biomechanics of how easy a slope angle is it also too if there's like high stumps or like shin level stumps having long legs be useful cuz you can step over them yeah it's not really a lot of speed actually something else is that land speed can be affected by if you have a partner I guess that would be planting speed okay so there's a difference land speed is not the same as moto speed you can move slowly through fast land so if land speed is really just like the the difficulty of the land that's the main thing that makes the speed difficulty as in the risk scale risk intensity complexity emotion you could have slow land if it's cold out you could have slow land if you can't feel your fingers and you just hate your life
