# 🔻<span class="via">Limit</span>

- Limit of your reach
Limit of space

There are no lines that are preventing you from jumping a kilometer into the air. The limit is abstract

## Limited by 🟠 Anatomy

- MaxReach
    - My arm isn't long enough
- RangeOfMotion
    - I'm not flexible enough to get my foot that high
- You can't reach through your torso, like how you can't reach through a wall

## Limited by 🔻 Time

- There's not enough time left to do another BagOut.

## Limited by 🔻 Space

- Proximity
- The Border of a Zone
    - PieceBorder: You can't go past the OrangeFlag

## Limited by 💜 ANIMA

- I can't remember that much information
- I can't see that far
- I can't hear that quiet sound

## Limited by  🟩 Eko

- Obstacle's Boundaries
- You can't see or move through walls
- Can't see over the hill
- A Piece and ArmReach both have limits
