::: details &

- A Slope isn't an Orientation, like how a "Cliff" isn't either.
    - Landform
    - A dune isn't the same as a flat land which is inclined. The soil is stacked. Gravity isn't perpendicular to surface of a slope, which makes the surficial material act differently than a flat surface.
