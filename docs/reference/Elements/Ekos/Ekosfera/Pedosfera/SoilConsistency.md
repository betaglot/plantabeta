- In soil science and geotechnical engineering, the "softness" or "hardness" of soil is formally referred to as consistence (for both cohesive and non-cohesive soils) or consistency (specifically for fine-grained or cohesive soils).

- Soil consistence refers to the soils resistance to deformation or rupture and its degree of cohesion and adhesion. Consistence of wet soil is classified in terms of stickiness (nonsticky, slightly sticky, sticky, or very sticky) and plasticity (nonplastic, slightly plastic, plastic, or very plastic). Consistence is classified for moist soil as loose, very friable, friable, firm, or very firm. For dry soil consistence is classified as loose, soft, slightly hard, hard, very hard, extremely hard, or rigid. Cementation refers to brittle, hard consistence due to some cementing substance. The classes of cementation are weakly cemented, strongly cemented, and indurated.

- Soil so soft that the blade goes in a stays by itself when dropped from a given height
