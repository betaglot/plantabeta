    - How?

- ((Strategy + Taktik - Plan) = Uncoordinated Action). You know what you want to do and how to do it, but nobody knows who is doing it or when it starts.
    - Cattle Plant where a group arrives at the cache, when the rest of the planters are too far into the land to communicate with.
- ((Strategy + Plan - Taktik) = Rigid Inflexibility). You have a goal and a schedule, but you don't know how to actually execute the maneuvers on the ground.
    - A Team of Rookies who don't know what Bouncing is.
- ((Taktik + Plan - Strategy) = Busy Work). You are doing lots of things efficiently and on schedule, but you have no idea why or if it's actually helping you win.
    - Competing against another planter who is at a different cache, you don't know their current number. Kappas use this to uncertainty as motivation to play planters off each other.
