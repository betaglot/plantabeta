- Taktik: IntermediateAktion
    - A zwischenzug (German for "intermediate move") is a chess tactic where a player, instead of making an expected move (usually a recapture), first plays an unexpected move that creates an immediate, severe threat, forcing the opponent to respond. Also known as an intermezzo, this "in-between" move often changes the situation to the player's advantage, such as winning material or avoiding a bad exchange

- Taktik: Desperado
    - In chess, a desperado is a tactic where a piece, already trapped or certain to be captured, makes a final, valuable move—capturing an enemy piece or creating a significant threat—before it is lost, extracting maximum compensation from a doomed piece.
- Taktik
    - All Taktiks are Aktions, but not all Aktions are Taktikal

- Taktik is like the concept of Phrasing in Dance, especially when dancing as a team where members must coordinate. They must be in particular places at particular times to achieve an emergent phenomenon.
- Go back down your line in  when you're backfilling walk out and you won't have enough trees to BoustroLineBack. Especially in trenches since half full trench leaves a hole or forces deadwalking
