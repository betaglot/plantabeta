- Sweating
- Misting spray
- Fog
- Wind+Wet
- Uneven Temperature
    - Hands cold with warm Torso
    - Use extra insulation on Legs, since leg insulation doesn't hinder Aktions as much as Torso or Arm Insulation.
        - It's less uncomfortable to have sweaty legs than a sweaty back which can lead to a sweaty waist belt, which leads to skin erosion, which is an injury and uncomfortable

- Having a rain shield makes you feel better even if there is no difference in cold. It's not the wetness, but the cold that people dislike. Rain layer also prevents dermal evaporative cooling
