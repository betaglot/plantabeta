# Unlike Via, Moves Pages are composed of Definitions and Propositions

This is a Jump (Theorem), this is how to Jump (Problem), this is you jumping (Praktik)

This is a BoustroLine (Theorem), this how to construction a BoutroLine (Problem), this is land planted with a BoustroLine (Praktik)

Propositions never have errors. Errors only occur in Praktik

There is less Via than Moves. It makes more sense to group MoveElements by their definitions (their concrete objects)

Each BetaTipos is like a Book

EkoBook
ViaBook
MoveBook
PsikeBook

then later Books combine them into Beta

BetaBook1
    - Deadwalking is a waste of time
BetaBook2
    - How to plant faster
