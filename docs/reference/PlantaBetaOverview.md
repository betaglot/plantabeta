- TeamPut() is BETA
- You don't need BETA to be a TreePlantor. BETA is just a Wrapper for communication. It's an API, an Interface between you and your coworkers.
- Use Code snippets to write abbreviated names to insert Tags or ElementName

- Independent Modules
    - EKOS is not required for Attention
    - BodyBend does not require VIA
    - Some ANIMA only uses ANIMAConcepts, like Emotional Regulation. If a function uses more than one module then it is BETA.

- Everything is an Object, like Python

Each PlantaBETA module is composed of problems and theorems. Problems all have solutions, they aren't proven valid yet, but are still useful for development. Pertainent negative. Science proves hypotheses wrong. NullHypotheses.

EKOS doesn't have any problems or theorems

- Strategy
    - Plan of Action

BETA can be a description or an instruction

- "BETA.BETAEvent"
- "BETA.BETAInstance"
- "BETA.BETAInstance.BETAInstanceComparison"
- "BETA.BETAName"
- "BETA.BETAAttributes.BETAAccuracy"
- "BETA.BETAAttributes.BETAPrecision"
- "BETA.BETAAttributes.BETAType"
- "BETA.BETAAttributes.ElementCount"
- "BETA.BETAAttributes.SubsystemCount"
- "BETA.BETAQuestion"
- "BETA.Overview"

- VIA just gives the options, BETA is required to Solve, since solution requires MOTON. BETA occurs when more than module is required in 1stPersonPoint of view. Plantor's perspective.

- BETAglot is the Parent Organization of PlantaBeta and KlimBeta
    - BETAGLOT.org is the Website
    - BETAGLOT.py is the Python Library
    - Youtube.BETAGLOT
    - Instagram.BETAGLOT
    - Snapchat.BETAGLOT
- PlantaBeta is the Organization
    - PlantaBeta.com is the Website
    - PlantaBeta.py is the Python Library
- KLIMBETA is a sibling Organization
    - KLIMBETA.com is the Website
    - KLIMBETA.py is the Python Library

- You don't give MOTOR
    - You give beta praktik
    - Can you give me some beta teori

You only
