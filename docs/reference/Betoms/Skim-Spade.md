    - 2FingerCollarMano
- Which mechanical Linkage is analogous to SpadeSkreef?
    - 2 Fulcrums
- SpadeChopSkreef
    - SpadeChop is used anywhere, SpadeChopSkreef is only used when Skreefing a Site.
    - SpadeChop is often a Loop
    - RedRotChop
        - Chop a RedRot log into a smaller chunk, then throw it
    - BranchChop
        - Aim for where the branch connects to the trunk, so the branch can't elastically absorb the impact
    - PoaChop or RootChop
        - Poa must be under tension
            - BootSlide to apply tension
- SpadeXSkreef
    - CollarHand crosses from left to right while skreefing, making an X with the shaft and also an X shaped skreef on the ground
    - Use when skreefing through a thick layer of duff which is collapsing into the site
    - Use when skreefing through a loose layer of duff to search for the best Mikrosite
- ArmWrestleSkreef. ArmLock then use your whole body

- Only the first Aktion is a pry the rest are skim
- SpadeSkim
    - Lower HypoMano decreases the force required to grip the spade
    - And Lower HypoMano also reduces energy loss. The movement of the Spade takes energy which could have been transferred into the SkreefSite
- Thumbs up for spade hypomano skreef
    - Thumbs up for spade hypomano skreef

    - Some part of your lower hand must be touching this tape when you're skreefing
    - Physics experiment
    - I put from the tip as they vary hypomano position along shaft
    - Ensure that instructor is standing at an angle to reduce probability of getting hit by the blade
