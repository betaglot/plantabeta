- Body move overview every single move is a body move so body move is the superset of everything because a planter is a body so there's body moves and then there's each limb has their own particular variation for about for a body move body moves

-  a good image for the body move would be I think it'd be a good idea to have a picture of the body that planters don't normally see so like a top few would be good body moves the biggest 

- the most important body move that planters need to be aware of is a fall so the other thing with body moves is that since they are pretty high scope choosing the right body move really matters because like what's an example of choosing a body move I guess going climbing over something that would be a body move because it's multiple sub motos to get to use your legs and your arms together in a concerted concurrent 

-  what's the difference between concurrent and concerted moto they kind of seem like they would be the same 

- body move if you're climbing over something or if you're ducking under something or if you just go around it that can greatly affect efficiency and it doesn't even really matter what the sub moves are how efficient those are if you mess up the body move that's that will affect your efficiency the most

- is it deductive or is inductive how you get to the body move so do you start with the body move or do you think of all the sub moves and from that set of Submotos you decide what the body move should be so that could make sense depending on the soil so like say say if you find a microsite and instead of walking over and just bending down you walk over then you step on a high piece of land and then you kind of Superman punch into the ground 

- Superman slam I guess I should say into the ground so that would be a body move stepping up a little bit to use the full weight the full gravity mass of your body on the Spade on the spadeslam this will allow you to be more efficient because your body needs to come down anyway so it's nice to use gravity with use gravities acceleration as a positive
