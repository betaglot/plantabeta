# Komposition

> something that a person has created or written, esp. a text, a work of art, or a piece of music, or the act of creating or writing something

## Proof

Kompositions are prooved to be coherent. You can't have a disjunction. The AnteElement must finish where the CurrentElement starts

## A Komposition of Kompositions

A 🔷<beta>BETA Komposition</beta> is composed of interdependent BetaType Kompositions.

## Theatre

The closest thing to a BetaKomposition is a Theatre Komposition, since:
    - All BetaTypes
    - Performed in one go, unlike film

> 🟠<motor>Dance</motor> 🔻<via>to the center</via> of 🟩<ekos>the stage</ekos> while 💜<anima>singing to music</anima>

### The movements of actors is a 🟠<motor>MOOVES Komposition</motor>

### Stage Directions a 🔻<via>VIA Komposition</via>

### Scenery is an 🟩<ekos>EKOS Komposition</ekos>

### Music and Speech are 💜<anima>Anima Kompositions</anima>

## Elements of a Komposition

A Komposition must have a start and finish, although the start and finish can be the same, like an infinite loop

## What is the difference between Komposition and Proposition?

Proposition and Kompositions both are dependent on earlier elements.

There are no proofs in a Komposition

## The Kompositions of architecture are buildings

The Kompositions of Architecture aren't usually LinearBeta (unless it's a bridge)

NonLinear

Architecture is NonLinear like BETAKOSMOS while Music (except Jazz) is Linear like BETA

## Choreography

## Music Komposition

Motif

Fugue

Sonata

Symphony

Etude

## Visual Komposition

## 🟩<ekos>MiseEnScene</ekos>

- the type of place and situation in which the action of a film or play happens
- French, mise en scène literally means "the action of putting onto the stage." The term's use originated in stage drama, where it refers to the way actors and scenery props are arranged; as its usage expanded into other narrative arts, its meaning shifted. In film production, mise en scène refers to all of the elements that comprise a single shot; that includes, but is not limited to, the actors, setting, props, costumes, and lighting. The director of a play or film is called the metteur en scène—literally, "one who puts on the stage."

## Fashion

Stylists compose Outfits, while Designers create the actual outfits. Sometimes the designer does both.
