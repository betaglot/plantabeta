## Cognitive Map

Mental representation of Eco to construct Route

> three basic elements of cognitive map based navigation spatial coding, landmark anchoring, and route planning

### Spatial Coding

### Landmark Anchoring

- North
- CacheLocation
- PieceFront
- RockOutcrop
- Mature tree which is uncut.



### Route Planning

RoutePlan vs. ActualRoute


## <eco>EcoSpace</eco>

### Navigation

#### Route Search

#### Route Aiming

Wayfinding

#### Walking

When to slow down
