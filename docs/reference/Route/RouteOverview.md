## What is a Route?

- Computational Geometry
- The interface between Move, Neuro and Eco.
- Route is an abstract layer on top of Eco. A route is where the Planter
- A routes start and finish at the Cache.

### Purpose of Route

- Minimize Deadwalking
- To be able to have a detailed mental model of your land, so that you can plan how you're going to fill your lang.

Route is Represented as a Red Triangle Emoji ðŸ”º

> a particular way or direction between places

> a method of achieving something


Also Known As "Land Management"

[Routing](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/routing)

> the use of a particular path or direction for something to travel or be placed

## Routing Scope

PieceFill > AreaFill > RouteCurve > RoutePoint

## GeneralDirection

## FillPattern

> A *FillPattern* is the RouteCurve, 

> A Series of Points

### Complete Coverage Path

> Complete coverage path planning algorithm, on the other hand, is used in application where an autonomous mobile robot is required to visit all the points at least once in the given environment size with known obstacles.

## RouteError

- Deadwalking
- GhostLine

## FillError

### PinchedEco

- FrontFillError

## $$$
- Route Affects productivity the most because route has deadwalking and cache positioning. Route Starts and Finishes at the cache. 

- Even the most atheletic planter is wasting time during deadwalking. Minimizing deadwalking benefits all planters and supervisors.
