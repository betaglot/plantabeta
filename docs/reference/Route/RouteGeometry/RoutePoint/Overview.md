## Site vs Microsite

- Sites are the location in Eco where a seedling can be planted, while microsites are the specific locations within a site where the tree is planted. Microsites take into account the roots or rocks which are in obstacles to the seedling. A microsite is the size of your hand, while a site 

___ | **Site** | **Microsite**
--- | --- | ---
**Size** | Thing | OtherThing


## Point Interpolation

- Interpolation is a type of estimation, a method of constructing (finding) new data points based on the range of a discrete set of known data points.
