Plantbeta is the Python package which is used to formally write Beta.

## Philosophy

::: tip Bjarne Stroustrup to Lex Fridman

> "Philosophy is important for C++ because you are determining what people can express and how. "

> "What can be outputted?"

## Python

Use Python's syntax to code Put(Plant).

```py
def Plant():
    

for Tree in Bag:
    Plant(Tree)

```

```py

for Bundle in Box:
    if BundleInverted == True:
        BundleFlip()
    else:
        BundlePeel

```

## Structure

### Phrase

> A dance phrase or sequence can be likened to a sentence formed when speaking. Sometimes we refer to dance phrases as moto sequences. For the purpose of this lesson either term is acceptable. Each phrase has a beginning, middle, and end. Motoments selected in a dance phrase may flow one to the other naturally or may be connected by a transition moto. Evolving dance sequences from action words is another way to demystify the creative process. Action words lead to the formation of individual dance phrases and provide the framework for further developing those phrases into larger compositional forms. In this lesson, the action words are common terms used in contemporary dance.

Sequence

## Loop

```py

for Tree in bag:
    if ValidMicrosite:
        Put(Tree)
        Get(Tree)
    else:
        Test()
# test another Microsite

```

## Classes

```py

class Trench(PrepLand):
 

class SpadeSlam(Moto):
    def __init(self, MotoLocation)
```

### Instance Variable

> Variable created during object instantiation

A more accurate name for "variable" is "assignable" since many variables don't vary, they remain constant after being assigned a value

Instantiate and EcoFactor with an empty string for Via

```py



```

## Methods

See [BetaMethods](/reference/)

```py
def Put(PlantType: str, Location: str, TreeCount: int, TreeType: str, ScreefBoolean: bool):

```

### Put(Flag)

```py
def Put(Flag, FlagColor: str, FlagType: str, HandMove: str)
```

## ReservedWords

```py

ReservedWords = [
    
]

```

## State

State is the value of a variable at a given time or set of conditions.

Variables change their values. They are assigned a new value.

Changing Values

As you move through the land the EcoState is constantly changing. Remember that Eco is from the first person point of view. The Geology and Botany remains static, but Eco is relative to where you are in the land. The land under your feet is constantly changing.

> CurrentState

### EcoState

- TemperatureState
- TimeState
- EcoDensityState
- SoilState
- TopoState
    - SlopeAngle

### MotoState

- MotoState
- FatigueState

### NeuroState

- Vigilance
- Mindset
- Preparedness
    - Ready Set Go

### ViaState

- CurrentTheorem
- Direction
- ViaDensityState
- ViaSurfaceState

## Stack

> the last one in is the first one out

Bag

## Control Flow Statement

### Conditional Statement

#### If

#### Else

```py

def SpadeTest():
# find an EcoSurface to test    
    
    if(Subsurface != Rock):
        return true
    else:
        SpadeTest()
```

#### Exception

Do this except if this happens

```py

except

```

## Recursive beta optimization

- Optimization Sequence
- TopDown
- Choose the optimal beta, then optimize how you execute the beta

Put(Plant) is the website

You don't need to communicate Beta all the time, but when you do, Put(Plant) helps you to communicate it.

Beta is the syntax

Motos are the objects and functions

Plantbeta can be used in Planting and Climbing, on Put(Plant).com and Klimbeta.com

## Syntax Highlighting

## HTML

### Vue.js

- Beta as XML tags used in BetaDiagram. Use Vue to create a custom component for each BetaElement

Render a `BetaList[]` as Vue components

#### Input

```py

BetaList = [
    Cover,
    Climb,
    Log,
    MinimumSpace,
    ArmPut
]

for object in BetaList:
    VueRender(object)

```

#### Output

```vue

<Beta>
    <Via>Cover</Via>
    <Moto>Climb</Moto>
    <Eco>Log</Eco>
    <Via>MinimumSpace</Via>
    <Moto>ArmPut</Moto>
</Beta>

```
