# ðŸ”·ðŸ”· Beta Difficulty Overview

Beta Difficulty describes the total difficulty of a Climber's performance.

Anima is not scored in a BetaComp since it is difficult to observe directly and can be observed indirectly in the Moove and <via>Route</via> of a Climber's performance. The only place where Anima could be observed in a Climber is their emotional facial expressions, but Climbers are almost always facing the wall, so their face can't be seen.
