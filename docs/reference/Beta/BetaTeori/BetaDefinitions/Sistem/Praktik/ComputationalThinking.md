These are not a sequence, since they all depend on each other

## Decomposition

> The process of breaking down a large task into several subtasks.

## Pattern Recognition

> A problem solving technique that recognises patterns or similarities in data, or identifying parts of the problem that have known algorithmic solutions

Break Beta down into elements.

## Abstraction

> A set of techniques used to solve complex problems that involves removing unnecessary details so the main processes involved can be easily identified

## Algorithms

> A finite and well-defined sequence of steps that need to be followed to perform a task.
