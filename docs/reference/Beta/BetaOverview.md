# üî∑ <beta>What is Beta?</beta> üî∑

![BetaLogo](/BetaLogo.png)

Beta is information that you use to perform planting tasks.

Beta emerges from the interactions between Eco, Move, Route and Neuro.

## Origins of "Beta"

Betamax was a piece of hardware (similar to a VHS tape or cassete) which was used by climbers to record video of themselves climbing a rock. Climbers would share their Betamax tapes to give their friends information about how to climb a piece of rock.  

- If you're a climber, then you're likely familiar with the term "beta"

> In climbing _beta_ is the information about the _movements_, _sequences_, and _holds_ of a climb. If someone asks you for a climb's beta, then they want to know how you climbed it.

> Beta could be something as simple as the general type of _holds_, like ‚Äúit‚Äôs all slopers‚Äù or just the type of rock and length.

> Beta in climbing can be very detailed down to the exact way you _grip_ a specific hold i.e. ‚Äúpinch the left side with your first two fingers so there‚Äôs space to match with your other hand‚Äù.



## Analogy between Climbing and Planting

This each line are analog pairs. The equal signs = denotes where Climbing and Planting are exactly the same.

::: danger Why is it useful to relate Climbing to Planting?

- OffSeason Training
- Outdoor Climbing has a similar to Planting. 
- Many Planters are also Climbers and share many attributes.
  - Resilience, Ruggedness, Physically Fit
- You will get better at one by learning the other.

:::

## Definition(BetaInstance)

- Snapshot of what a Planter is doing and thinking in a particular Moment.
- The current state of the Eco, Route, Planter[Move, Neuro].
- An element of a BetaStack or BetaSequence.
- There is no time in a BetaInstance

## What is a Beta Element?

> An element is one of the parts of something that makes it work, or a quality that makes someone or something effective.

Plantbeta breaks down a Planter's experience into simple elements. Each element has its own particular properties which when varied affect

Changing an Element's properties affects how it relates to other elements and changes their properties too. These changes ripple out across Plantbeta's web of relationships.

### Synonyms

- Units
- Foundations
- First Principles
- Fundamental Principal
- Fundamental Unit
- Basic Part
- Building blocks

### Purpose of Elements

- The simplification of a Planter's experience.
- Chunking a Planter's experience into discrete pieces of information so that they can combined in novel ways.

#### Euclid's Elements of Geometry

The Euclid's Elements is compilation of elements which was written over 2000 years ago. Until last century most people studied <u>The Elements</u> in school. Planters mostly use the Elements from Book 1.

Each of the Beta Subsystems ([Eco](), [Move](), [Route](), [Neuro]() ) has its own elements, although most elements are a combination of all four subsystems. For example [HandClose]() depends on the [SoilType]() (Eco), [Touch and Pressure sensations]() (Neuro), and the obstacles which narrow the range of [approach trajectories]() possible to perform the [HandClose]() (Route).

Elements are added together to create new, more complex, elements. For example [SpadeScreef]() = {[HandleGrip](), [ShaftGrip](), [Soil](), [SlopeAngle](), [Slash](), [Attention]()}

### Element Properties

### Element Composition

Elements are mixed together to create more complex elements or linked together into a new sequence of elements.

#### Element Mixture Composition

- Adding Elements together
  - Like creating a Chemical Compound
    - [InsertImage] Water H20
- Increase Complexity
- Element Hierarchy

#### Element Sequence Composition

A sequential pattern of elements.

- MoveSequence
  - PlantingSeqence
- RouteSequence
- NeuroSequence

### Element Decomposition

#### Element Mixture Decomposition

Breaking down an element into more simple elements.
