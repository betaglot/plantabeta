# 🔷 <beta>What is Beta?</beta>

> Beta is the **information** that you use to perform planting tasks.

<beta>Beta</beta> emerges from the interactions between <ekos>Eko</ekos>, <mooves>Moove</mooves>, <via>Via</via> and <psike>Psike</psike>.

::: details Why is it called <beta>Beta</beta>?

## Etymology of "<beta>Beta</beta>"

Betamax was a piece of hardware (similar to a VHS tape or cassete) which was used by climbers to record video of themselves climbing a rock. Climbers would share their Betamax tapes to give their friends information about how to climb a piece of rock.  

- If you're a climber, then you're likely familiar with the term "beta"

> In climbing _beta_ is the information about the _motos_, _sequences_, and _holds_ of a climb. If someone asks you for a climb's beta, then they want to know how you climbed it.

> Beta could be something as simple as the general type of _holds_, like “it’s all slopers” or just the type of rock and length.

> Beta in climbing can be very detailed down to the exact way you _Mano_ a specific hold i.e. “pinch the left side with your first two fingers so there’s space to match with your other hand”.

## Analogy between Climbing and Planting

This each line are analog pairs. The equal signs = denotes where Climbing and Planting are exactly the same.

## How is it useful to relate Climbing to Planting?

- OffSeason Training
- Outdoor Climbing has a similar to Planting.
- Many Plantors are also Climbers and share many attributes.
    - Resilience, Ruggedness, Physically Fit
- You will get better at one by learning the other.

## <beta>What is a Beta Element?</beta>

Based on Gymnastics Elements. Elements are completed using Beta Factors. Multiple alternative Factors can be used to complete an Element.

- 🔷SelectSite
- 🔷CloseHole

## Constraints when Implementing <beta>Beta</beta>

What are the the constraints for each module when implementing Beta in PlantaBeta?

### <beta>Beta Constraints</beta>

- TeamBeta is constrained by the level of ability and knowledge of each team member
    - You can't BounceCover if your teammate doesn't know what BouceCover is.

### <via>Via Constraints</via>

Via is often a lack of knowledge of what's over the hill or around the corner

- bag weight constrains Via Length

### <mooves>Moove Constraints</mooves>

- Moove is metabolic energy
- bag weight

### <psike>Psike Constraints</psike>

Psike is

### <ekos>Eko Constraints</ekos>

Eko is weather, if you are in fog you can't see eko. Remember that eko is the object of environment, which always exists. Eko requires perception. Eko requires Psike

## Beta.Error

There is a miscommunication happening if:

- TeamPut() is Beta
- You don't need Beta to be a TreePlantor. Beta is just a Wrapper for communication. It's an API, an Interface between you and your coworkers.
- Use Code snippets to write abbreviated names to insert Tags or ElementName

## Independent Modules

- Eko is not required for Attention
- BodyBend does not require Via
- Some Psike only uses NeuroConcepts, like Emotional Regulation. If a function uses more than one module then it is Beta.

- Everything is an Object, like Python

> Beta is what you actually do implement
> Elements are just options possibilities
> Beta requires decision

Each PlantaBeta module is composed of problems and theorems. Problems all have solutions, they aren't proven valid yet, but are still useful for development. Pertainent negative. Science proves hypotheses wrong. NullHypotheses.

Eko doesn't have any problems or theorems

## Strategy

- Plan of Action

Beta can be a description or an instruction

<h2>PageTags</h2>

- "Beta.BetaEvent"
- "Beta.BetaInstance"
- "Beta.BetaInstance.BetaInstanceComparison"
- "Beta.BetaName"
- "Beta.BetaAttributes.BetaAccuracy"
- "Beta.BetaAttributes.BetaPrecision"
- "Beta.BetaAttributes.BetaType"
- "Beta.BetaAttributes.ElementCount"
- "Beta.BetaAttributes.SubsystemCount"
- "Beta.BetaQuestion"
- "Beta.Overview"

There are no units of Beta, except for Tokens

Token, Block, Module

Only Beta can be the solution

Via Theorem, Via Solution

Via just gives the options, Beta is required to Solve, since solution requires Moove. Beta occurs when more than module is required in 1stPersonPoint of view. Plantor's perspective.

Psike that just thinks about PsikeElements
