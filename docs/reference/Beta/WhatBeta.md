Each Plantbeta module is composed of problems and theorems. Problems all have solutions, they aren't proven valid yet, but are still useful for development. Pertainent negative. Science proves hypotheses wrong. NullHypotheses.

Eco doesn't have any problems or theorems

Only Beta can be the solution

Via Theorem, Via Solution 

Via just gives the options, Beta is required to Solve, since solution requires Moto. Beta occurs when more than module is required in 1stPersonPoint of view. Planter's perspective.

Neuro that just thinks about NeuroElements

## Origins of "Beta"

Betamax was a piece of hardware (similar to a VHS tape or cassete) which was used by climbers to record video of themselves climbing a rock. Climbers would share their Betamax tapes to give their friends information about how to climb a piece of rock.  

- If you're a climber, then you're likely familiar with the term "beta"

> In climbing _beta_ is the information about the _motos_, _sequences_, and _holds_ of a climb. If someone asks you for a climb's beta, then they want to know how you climbed it.

> Beta could be something as simple as the general type of _holds_, like ‚Äúit‚Äôs all slopers‚Äù or just the type of rock and length.

> Beta in climbing can be very detailed down to the exact way you _grip_ a specific hold i.e. ‚Äúpinch the left side with your first two fingers so there‚Äôs space to match with your other hand‚Äù.

::: danger Why is it useful to relate Climbing to Planting?

- OffSeason Training
- Outdoor Climbing has a similar to Planting. 
- Many Planters are also Climbers and share many attributes.
  - Resilience, Ruggedness, Physically Fit
- You will get better at one by learning the other.

## Definition(BetaInstance)

- Snapshot of what a Planter is doing and thinking in a particular Moment.
- The current state of the Eco, Via, Planter[Moto, Neuro].
- An element of a BetaStack or BetaPhrase.
- There is no time in a BetaInstance

## What is a Beta Element?

> An element is one of the parts of something that makes it work, or a quality that makes someone or something effective.

Plantbeta breaks down a Planter's experience into simple elements. Each element has its own particular properties which when varied affect

Changing an Element's properties affects how it relates to other elements and changes their properties too. These changes ripple out across Plantbeta's web of relationships.

```py

BetaElement = [
  'problem',
  'theorem',
  'definition',
  'axiom',
  'symbol',
]

```

::: tip Example of EcoElements

EcoProblem
> "How do I close this hole?"

> Where can I open a hole in this riparian and not have it flood with water.

EcoTheorem
> "Sand collapses by itself"

> "Clay sticks together and onto your SpadeBlade"

Each of the Beta Subsystems ([Eco](), [Moto](), [Via](), [Neuro]() ) has its own elements, although most elements are a combination of all four subsystems. For example [HandClose]() depends on the [SoilType]() (Eco), [Touch and Pressure sensations]() (Neuro), and the obstacles which narrow the range of [approach trajectories]() possible to perform the [HandClose]() (Via).

Elements are added together to create new, more complex, elements. For example [SpadeScreef]() = {[HandleGrip](), [ShaftGrip](), [Soil](), [SlopeAngle](), [Slash](), [Attention]()}
