## Purpose

## Captions

Beta as CaptionData. BetaCaptions are more useful when watching at Slow Frame Rate.

### ImplicitBeta

BetaCaptions and not just movement captions. Decide what to caption by using Information Theory

> Communicate the information which can't be predicted, interpolated, implied

Less detail isn't necessarily a bad thing
