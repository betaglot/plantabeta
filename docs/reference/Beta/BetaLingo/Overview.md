Beta Spoken or written in a Natural Language.

Beta is expressed using a Natural Language. In Put(Plant), Beta is only expressed in English, but will be translated to other languages, in particular French and Spanish.

A method of Beta is to print out a string describing the Beta in English. This seems like something AI would be good at.
