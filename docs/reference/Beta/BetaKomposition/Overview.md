To increase the weight of creativity in the BetaScore, the way tha Beta Elements are linked together is scored.

> **Choreography**

Only Possible when RouteExecution is Scored, so not in BETATERMA?

Interesting choice of Eco to use.

## Which BETATLON Types use Composition Score?

- BETAKOSMOS
- BetaBattle
- BETASYNERGY
- Betatekton
- BetaDance

Competitions with a fixed Route, like BETATERMA competitions, don't have a CompositionScore since there the <span class="labor">Route</span> greatly limits the range of possible movements.

## Variety

Repetition

Surprising combination

Repetition decreases CompositionScore.

## Progression

### New or Uncommon Elements

Progression can be recognized at any level of competition since it does not rely on MotoIntensity.

Naming new Elements after yourself is common practice in gymnastics, it is **not permitted**. Naming Elements after yourself hinders understanding of the new Element since it is not descriptive. Moreover naming Elements after people encourages having a big ego and ignores the fact that no innovation occurs in isolation. It is not fair to ignore the role of the Climbing community in a Klimber's innovation. Having descriptive ElementNames is critical for the accessibilty of BETATLONs.

### Creativity

Creativity is a subjective criteria which can apply to a creative <span class="labor">Route</span> Composition, MoveComposition, MoveExecution and a novel Move or Move Variation.

### Longevity of Progression

There will be lots of Progression in the first decade of BETATLONs, but the rate of progression will eventually slow. A slowing rate of progression can be observed in Gymnastics, Skateboarding, Skiing, Snowboarding.

Gymnastics is still adding new elements
