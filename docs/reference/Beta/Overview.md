# Why Beta??



## <u>What is Beta?</u>

### 'Beta' is from the climbing community

- If you're a climber, then you're likely familiar with the term "beta"

> In climbing *beta* is the information about the *movements*, *sequences*, and *holds* of a climb. If someone asks you for a climb's beta, then they want to know how you climbed it. 

> Beta could be something as simple as the general type of *holds*, like “it’s all slopers” or just the type of rock and length.

> Beta in climbing can be very detailed down to the exact way you *grip* a specific hold i.e. “pinch the left side with your first two fingers so there’s space to match with your other hand”.
