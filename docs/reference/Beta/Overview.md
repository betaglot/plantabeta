# 🔷 What is Beta? 🔷

## 'Beta' is from the climbing community

- If you're a climber, then you're likely familiar with the term "beta"

> In climbing _beta_ is the information about the _movements_, _sequences_, and _holds_ of a climb. If someone asks you for a climb's beta, then they want to know how you climbed it.

> Beta could be something as simple as the general type of _holds_, like “it’s all slopers” or just the type of rock and length.

> Beta in climbing can be very detailed down to the exact way you _grip_ a specific hold i.e. “pinch the left side with your first two fingers so there’s space to match with your other hand”.
