# What is Beta?



## 'Beta' is from the climbing community

- If you're a climber, then you're likely familiar with the term beta

> Climbing **beta** is information on the **moves**, **sequence**, or **holds** on a climb. If someone asks you for the beta on a climb they want to know how you did it. 

> Beta could be something as simple as the general type of **holds**, like “it’s all slopers” or just the type of rock and length.

> Beta in climbing can be very detailed down to the exact way you **grip** a specific hold i.e. “pinch the left side with your first two fingers so there’s space to match with your other hand”.
