## What is Environment?

Most Planters would call the Environment 'the Land', but it's more than just the Land. The Environment is every part of planting which isn't the Planter themselves. The seedlings; the land; the air; the precipitation; the sun and all the plants living or dead, are all elements of the Environment.
