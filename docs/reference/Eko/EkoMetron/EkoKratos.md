Eko Causes Panic

- Fear can be LowKratos, HighKratos Fear is Panic.
- Fear of Falling
- Deep Water Solo

- Performance Anxiety
    - Climbing in front of Spectators

## Examples of Eko Kratos

### Low Eko Kratos

### High Eko Kratos

- RoofWall
- WetWall
- Deep Water Solo

## Advantage

WallAngle

- Overhangs can be easier for ShortClimber.
    - CoreTension
    - FrontLever
    - Gainage
- ShortClimber has less leverage when performing movements which require FrontLever or Gainage.

HighAltitude Acclimatization

- Vail

## Altitude

- RouteKratos(++)
    - Competitions held in Vail where concentration of Oxygen is lower.
    - Altitude sickness
        - Feel out of breath, nausea, fatigue
- StrongWind
    - Being blown off the Wall.
    - AirResistance during Dyno.
- WarmAir
    - AirTemperature
        - Sending Temps
        - Sweat affects Kratos.
- WarmRouteSurface
    - WallTemperature
        - WarmRock
            - SunExposure

## Wet

When MargoHayes attempted Biographie(9a+) while it was WetRoute.

## Wall Angle

- SlabWall
    - Gravity decreases Grip Kratos of Vector into Wall as the WallAngle becomes more SlabWall.
- Gravity increases Grip Kratos as the WallAngle becomes more OverhangWall.
    - PinchGrip on a RoofWall.

- (WallAngle+SurfaceAngle+LoadingAngle)
    - Intense in which Direction. Grip can be intense IntoWall, DownWall, UpWall, OutOfWall. PinchGrip.Error.Slide on VerticalWall, slides DownWall, which PinchGrip.Error.Slide on OverhangWall is OutOfWall.
        - (MovementDirection)RelativeTo(Route)
            - IntoWall, DownWall, UpWall, OutOfWall
