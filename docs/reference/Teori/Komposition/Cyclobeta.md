This should be a Chart

## It's an Iterative Process

---
> a cycle of improvement

## 0. Choose a Target

## 1. Gather Data

- Ask another Atlete for Beta

- Look at all parts of the Eko
- See the Beta in Eko
- Look at the Eko

> "Scope it out"

## 2. Hypothesis

> an idea or explanation for something that is based on known facts but has not yet been proved

- Educated guess

- Practice the Beta in Eko

## 4. Analysis

- Why did this not work?
- What could choose different Elements to make this Beta easier?
- How could you change the attributes of this Beta to make it easier?

Analyze the results of the Test

### Discussion

> the activity in which people talk about something and tell each other their ideas or opinions

ShareBeta

Collaboration

## 5. Conclusion

> the opinion you have after considering all the information about something:

### Adapt Beta = New Hypothesis

### Find another Beta to try

- If the Beta is not possible for you then move on.

## 6. Link to other Beta
