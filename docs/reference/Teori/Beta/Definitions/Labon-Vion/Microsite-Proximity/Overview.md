# Proximity

> the Space that you move through while following a Line

## Space between PlantedTrees and Microsites

You're spacing for the branches of the fully grown trees.

## ViaTotalSpace

> The entire ViaSpace of Piece or BagUp.

## ViaStartSpace

> ViaStartSpace is the Space around ViaStartPoint

ViaStartSpace usually includes Cache unless WalkIn

ViaStartSpace is relative to ViaTotal

## ViaFinishSpace

## VIA Space Attributes

Space Form

Space Size

VIA Cell

### BodySlot

When performing a BodySlot between Obstacles, the ViaSpace is the Space between the Obstacles that the Plantor must fit through. If the ViaSpace is narrow, then the Plantor must BodyRotate to fit through the ViaSpace.

## Spacing

Placement of Trees

Parsing Land into VoronoiCells

### Partition

::: details üõ†

- Proximal is the nearest site
- The method of a ViaSpace is Cover()
- ViaSpace is the sum of all Lines, ViaSpace is useful to know since there are always small detours from Lines, there may be an Obstacle which causes a detour. You can detour from a Line while still remaining in a ViaSpace
- ‚ùå<error>TooFar</error>
- ‚ùå<error>TooClose</error>
- ViaSpace extends underground. You wouldn't want to step on quicksand
    - You need to consider what's under a <via>Contact</via> when üü†<motor>Stepping</motor> or üü†<motor>OpenHole</motor>
- ViaSpace is usually directly above Contact
- Most stable ViaSpace is aligned with Normal
