# <span class="beta">BETA</span> Structure (Data Structure)

<span class="beta">BETA</span> doesn't need to be Linear

- Data structures are fundamental ways to organize, store, and manage data in a computer for efficient access and modification, forming the backbone for effective algorithms and software, with common types including linear ones like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and queues, and non-linear ones like trees, graphs, and hash tables, each suited for different tasks from databases to search engines. They provide the physical structure for abstract data types (ADTs), making large datasets manageable for applications
