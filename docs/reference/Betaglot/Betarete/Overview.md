::: details &

-
- What are the hubs of Betaretetome
    - What Betoms are most connected to other Betoms
    - Is this different from asking about Betom Frequency?
    - A climber's IdioBetaRete grows as they learn. Preferential Attachment to the hubs that they already have. Slab climbers get more growth at Prokline clusters than Rekline. A well rounded climber has more hubs?
