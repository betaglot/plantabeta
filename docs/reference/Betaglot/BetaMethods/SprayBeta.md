# Spray<span class="beta">BETA</span>

::: warning

Do Not SprayBeta.

## Definition of SprayBeta

- Unsolicited GiveBeta.

- GiveBeta without AskBeta.

- Beta is "sprayed" when Beta is given without being asked for it.

- Can be a form of "mansplaining"

## Why not SprayBeta?

SprayBeta is like spoiling the plot of a movie or solving someone's puzzle. Part of the fun of Climbing is problem solving, so when someone sprays Beta they are reducing the potential fun that a Klimber can have while trying a Route.

Sometimes the sprayed Beta isn't even useful.

## Spray Range

Beta can be sprayed from one Klimber to another in a normal speaking volume or Beta can be sprayed over a larger range when it is yelled at a Klimber who is on the wall.

## Can you SprayBeta by Miming?

## BetaSpray on Social Media

::: danger

Even when you're not Climbing, you can still get sprayed with Beta!
