# 🔷🔷 Beta Difficulty Overview

Beta Difficulty describes the total difficulty of a Klimber's performance.

Anima is not scored in a BETATLON since it is difficult to observe directly and can be observed indirectly in the Move and <span class="labor">Route</span> of a Klimber's performance. The only place where Anima could be observed in a Klimber is their emotional facial expressions, but Klimbers are almost always facing the wall, so their face can't be seen.  

- Move Hesitation
- <span class="labor">Route</span> Alignment
- Variety
