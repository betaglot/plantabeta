# BETAGLOT

Betaglot is the structure that sews together all the elements and also defines how elements are made

BETAGLOT has the same structure of Euclid's Elements

BETAGLOT defines what BEtoms are, and what Elements are composed of

Because BETAGLOT is a way of thinking, it is independent of the activity that being used on.

BETAGLOT is a layer on top of the activity. It's like the analog wires connecting a breadboard or the switchboards of telephone stations

BETAGLOT is not the content. BETAGLOT is the system used to convert wordless thought and experience into something which can be written down on paper. To perform the activities you don't use much language. BETAGLOT is the language used to describe the activity, in the same way that the English word "cat" is not a cat, neither is the French word "chat". This is a philosophical definition of what languages are. The reason why BETAGLOT is pronounced this way is because it describes what it is like to BE the experience of the sport or activity. You are soccer when you're playing soccer. You lose your self of self when in the flow state. A peak performance you're in the flow state the whole time, so BETAGLOT describes what it is like to be at peak performance, it is an ideal model. Not all athletes are able to be at peak performance.

BETAGLOT is not static, it changes, it is growing

A language is more than just a classification

The rules of English define that a word must be

All words must have a definition and a grammatical classification

Do I use KlimBeta while climbing? No, because I'm inventing it. Since BETAGLOT is a layer on experience

You shouldn't be thinking about BETAGLOT while BEING the experience. You should be thinking about the content of the BETAGLOT. It would be distracting to be thinking about a dendrogram of all the connections to an element. It would be distracting to be thinking about all the variations of a mikrosite beside a stump. BETAGLOT is a tool to get information into your unconsciousness, since your mind works more like a graph theory diagram than a page of text.

The sequence of stoicheia is arbitrary. The latter elements. It can go from 37 back to 10, then to 2, then 1 and then onwards to 38. "37,10,2,38" is not the order of numbers. Euclid isn't read linearly, because you're constantly turning back to previous pages. Harken back, recapitulate, foreshadow, allude. Epics repeat. Everything relies on the past. STOICHEIA

To be able to describe experience

What is the benefit of six faktors

Reuse. Learning a

Faktors show what concepts are related. The elements in VIA are mostly composed of only other elements of VIA, same with MOTOR.

Faktors give syntax. Faktors allow you to make the communication of BETA less confusing by using a fixed syntax. So you don't need to know all the different ways of saying something. Euphemisms, Nickname, slang.

Faktors give inheritance to their elements. What properties do each of the elements of LABOR share?
Metod, Attribute

Each element is an Object, each object has methods and Attributes. Faktors are classes. Elements inherit class methods and class attributes. An example of a class attribute is the rule that Ama can take a Direction as an argument, but it can't take a Voronoi Diagram. What can and can't be combined. There's no point in trying to dyno if you can't hold yourself from the target Plast. The combination of BETA is not valid. <BB labor="FrontLever" soma="Me"/>. A BETOM always requires all Faktors to be completely explicit, a BETOM implicitly must be possible, that is the contribution of VIA to the BETOM <BB labor="FrontLever" soma="Me"/>. I can't do a front lever because I'm not strong enough, my SOMA doesn't afford the ability to hold myself horizontally under a bar.

Faktors contribute to , they're fellows

BETA is an emergent property resulting from the combination of at least two elements of experience.

Where are you when you're adding 2 + 2? The experience is math.

You could say almost anything in English, so it's not easy to predict what will happen next. Constraining your communication system allows greater prediction.

The next sentence could be almost anything, even when you're talking about a specific thing in an activity. Each sentence is an idea. Meanwhile the next idea in BETAGLOT is limited to maybe a couple hundred.

When you're planting thousands of trees a day, why would you expect there to. 200 is easier to deal with than infinity. A system of 500 elements is easier to communicate, to recreate in another person's head, than words

BETAGLOT is the glowing stuff that Dumbledore pulls out of his head. It wasn't an amorphous blob, it had structure.

I feel like I need to justify its existence. You don't need to justify. The reader should be able to see for themselves. Proof is not meaning to be convincing. You shouldn't be convinced of the truth, truth isn't an opinion. There is no place for doubt within the system. You can doubt the system, but the system doesn't use doubt.

Just show what BETAGLOT is.
