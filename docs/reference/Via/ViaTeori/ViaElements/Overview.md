# ViaElements

- ViaElements don't require Eko or Moove
- ViaCompositions do require Eko or Moove
- All Beta always requires Psike

## Differentiate(Composition, Proposition)

- With + position
- From + position

All Definitions are Elements

- These are all Definitions
    (Time)
    (Space)
    (Point)
    (Obstacle)
    (Marka)
    (Line)
    (Limit)
    (Direction)
    (Contact)

The length of a Via in climbing is from StartPoint to FinishPoint

- The Length of PlantaBeta

The block isn't a limit for Eko, it's a sign that says, "Don't walk past this flag"

You could Marka while climbing, but there is no need, beside tick mark. You nearly always just need to go up, which isn't confusing

## Complete the Via

### Complete a Zone

- Zone is a grouping of Space and arbitrarily limited by Marka

### Complete a Line

- Line is a grouping of Contacts, Direction and Space(room to move), limited by Time
