> The area of the circle who's radius is created by a plot cord of a given length, usually 4 meters

You Plot EcoDensity, not ViaDensity. ViaDensity is the density of planned Microsites, while EcoDensity is the density of planted Neons

A plot is almost always a circle, some checkers implement the plot as a sphere. When the Plot is a Sphere then Neons can be closer together on slopes.
